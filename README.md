# Repository Exploration:

## Coursework (Algorithm Design and Analysis):
Repository demonstrating various programming assignments in Java, where I implement many different algorithms such as Prims algorithm, depth first search and breadth first search, and more, using various data structures.

## Database Design Final:
Repository demonstrating my final project for my Database Design for the Web class, where I implemented many languages such as PHP, HTML, CSS, and a little Javascript, as well as implementing knowledge of databases with MySQL, to create a personal fully functioning website which uses all techniques mentioned.
#### Website Description: 
The website is one which features movies, TV shows, and books, which you can then add to your personal list to keep track of which pieces of media you’ve consumed and where you’re at within them, such as page number. All records on the site are queried from an Oracle database using MySQL, and the user can input their own piece of media which would then be stored in the database and displayed on the site in real time.

## Mini Surveillance System:
Repository demonstrating everything learned in my Computer Organization class, where we created personal projects using the Raspberry Pi, Python, Flask, and more. I created a surveillance system, and in this repository exists all the code and functionality I created to realize this goal.

## pythonSortingGraphing: 
Repository demonstrating how a team member and I revisited old C++ projects for Data Structures and Algorithms, where we added Python and matplotlib to automate data visualization for the sorting algorithms from the old projects.

## Secure Intranet System
Repository demonstrating principles learned in my Cybersecurity Principles class, where I use Python, Flask, and many techniques such as hashing, authentication, and more, to create a website which has a few different accounts with different access levels, where this is verified, and the areas you can explore in the website are dependent on your access level.

## C++ Boxing Repo Link
Link to a repository demonstrating many techniques and programming concepts learned in my Advanced Programming (C++) class, where I had full creative agency to create any project I want using all concepts learned, and I chose to create a boxing game. Because the repository is so large, the link is present to take you to the repository.

## Javascript Samurai Fighting Link
Link to a repository demonstrating skills I learned from a tutorial and built on to create a fluidly animated, real time fighting game which can be played by two players on the same keyboard.

## Software Engineering Group Project 1: Spotify Dataset Querying
Link to a repository for a group project, where we pooled data from Spotify's Top Artists of 2023 and created programs where users can ask any query on the dataset, and where we parse the query into a valid query for Google Firebase, which is the noSQL database we used to store this data.
