review/summary: Warning: will cause bad breathe (but oh, so delicious)
review/text: These chips are very very good. The flavoring on them is the perfect bbq flavor. Unfortunately they leave you with terrible breath (maybe don't eat them before going in for a kiss or talking in someone's face!).<br /><br />They have an odd crisp that's unsettling at first, but if you give it a try, you get used to it, and will most likely enjoy it. You eat them expecting that crunch of a potato chip, but are greeted by something more airy. It's a pretty unique texture that's not much like what I've eaten before.<br /><br />They are not baked or fried, but popped. Which means less calories and fat. They also seem to have the ability to fill me up even though the bag is small (smaller than most I think). So that is a double win.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend trying these in store before investing in a big box of these unless you are adventurous (or generous enough to give away if they displease you)...but DO try them!

review/summary: LOVE these chips!
review/text: I was lucky to have ordered chips on a Virgin America flight and was so excited to see them on Amazon!  They are light and crispy and they do not have MSG or anything bad in them.  They only have about 100 calories per bag and around 3 grams of fat.  I love them!  If you are a chip lover, try them!

review/summary: Much better than I thought
review/text: I only had the BBQ flavor since the variety pack was OOS at the time I ordered. This was the first time I ate these and they are much better than I expected. I read the reviews and saw that it got a lot of praises, but still skeptical since people's taste buds aren't the same. Once I received it, tried a bag and these are great. They aren't greasy at all and pack a lot of flavor. I rather eat these whenever I feel like I need a snack than original potatoes chips or something that's a bit greasy.<br /><br />Either way, these are great. Go to their website and see if you can find a vendor near you. Buy a bag to try out and if you love it, just keep getting more from your retail store or buy 'em cheaper here on Amazon!

review/summary: Great introduction to these chips
review/text: Okay, I personally loved how these chips taste. They are super crunchy and flavorful. I chose to take away one star because the Sea Salt & Vinegar flavor was way too salty. BBQ was my favorite. Next time I order, I am getting just the BBQ. They taste just like the greasy unhealthier versions made by other brands. The Cheddar was good but you can tell it was a healthy version of this flavor chips. The rest of the flavors I would say taste as they normally do, nothing special or out of the typical range of those flavors.

review/text: Can't say enough about these chips.  They are only 3 Weight watchers points and are very satisfying.  Hard to believe they are healthy.  I like the portion control of single serve bags for myself and they are quick to pack in a lunch.  One of these bags is a lot more filling than a small bag of chips and taste even better.  I also bought the 3 ounce bags since my entire family loves these. Try these once and you will be hooked.

review/summary: These things are sooooo addictive
review/text: These things are great. I have tried most of the flavors and each one is great. When you open your first bag and put a popchip in your mouth and start eating it, it has a very different texture than you would expect, At-least for me, I did not know what to expect for the texture, and the first few I ate I was I was not sure if I would like it, but then the flavors started to do a happy dance in my mouth, and I got use to the texture and now I cannot get enough of these. They are very addictive, like a legal drug.. They are filling, low in calories and fat. They are my new favorite chips.<br /><br />I recommend going to the website and sending the company an email to let them know what you think of the chips. They are excited to hear what you think and may send you some coupons just for emailing them.<br /><br />If you have never tried these, do it, they are worth it. This variety pack is worth it, good price, great chips. I am eating a bag of bbq while I write this and have a bag of plain popchips waiting for me later. For a chip like this, I didn't have high expectations for the plain chips. Some low fat chips and foods that don't have seasoning taste bland and not work it, not these, even the plain chips have great flavor.

review/summary: The best chips EVER!
review/text: PopChips are the best potato chips I have ever had, hands down.  The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy.  The calories and fat are very low.  No frying, so the chips are very healthy - at least for a chip.  You can satisfy that salt and crunch craving with these, no problem.  But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case.  One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!

review/text: After reading the positive reviews about the variety packs, I picked up a bag at my local pharmacy.<br />At 100 calories per bag, this is a great snack that has a great taste and texture.<br /><br />Like their bag states, they are not fried (bad for you),  they are not baked (no taste),  but "popped",  which gives them a slightly thicker but lighter and crispy taste.<br /><br />They really are good.  Try a bag when you get a chance...if you haven't fully kicked all your junk food habits, you'll be glad you did!!

review/summary: Delicious Low-Fat Potato Chip
review/text: My husband loves pop chips, as a low-fat alternative to other potato chips.  They don't sell them at our regular grocery store, so we bought them on-line through Amazon.  The pop chips came on-time, packaged well, and it's cheaper to buy them in bulk like this!

review/summary: I never thought I'd switch from 'chips'
review/text: I am an avid chip eater. Ever since I was a child (I'm now 29),I was always a 'salty' tooth.<br /><br />I've gone through Ruffles and every other type of chip.<br /><br />The problem is that no matter if I buy a small or large bag; I'd have to finish it in one sitting.<br /><br />I read about this item in my "Shape" magazine for being a low-calorie food and yet being yummy.<br /><br />I tried to find at my local stores but haven't been able to (I live in the Seattle area).<br /><br />Thankfully, I found on Amazon and anxiously awaited my case to come. I was a little nervous to commit to a whole case but was pleasantly surprised when I opened my first bag.<br /><br />I chose this size (0.8-oz over 3-oz) cause I think it's about the right size for a lunch bag.<br /><br />The flavor has a little bit of a kick with it, not too spicy but definitely not a boring bbq flavor.<br /><br />I highly recommend anyone who loves chips but can't stop with just one to try a bag of these. They definitely satisfy and don't taste like they're not fried.

review/text: We received a sampler package from Amazon that had several flavors....cheddar, bbq, sour cream/onion, plain, salt and pepper, and also the salt and vinegar.<br /><br />I've already received our first shipment of just the vinegar version.  These are a good salty fix without the calories...and each proportioned pouch is satisfying in one sitting.  I would've liked to try the garlic parm but it wasn't included.<br /><br />Our #1 is salt and vinegar and #2 would probably be the salt and pepper.

review/text: These BBQ chips are crisp, well-spiced, & satisfying.  I don't eat as many of these at 1 sitting as I do with regular (Lay's) BBQ chips.<br />We were buying these at Costco for a short while.  The problem with Costco is that when items become very popular, their bulk cost goes up & Costco moves on to carry something else.  Not even Central Market (TX) carries these!  Thanks goodness for Amazon.  I am signing up for the automatic re-ordering program!

review/text: I really like these. One reviewer mentioned they have soy in them. The last ingredient in them is soy lecithin (emulsifier)which is in many store bought foods. It is not a soy product though. I have to keep my soy intake down because I have Lupus but these do not bother me. They are quite salty and on the rare occasion when I made a pig of myself and ate the whole bag it made my tongue sore. They are really good though. I bought mine at Trader Joe's but am delighted to find them now at Amazon (for only 11 cents more a bag) as it is a pain to go shopping and have to get my wheelchair in and out of the car. I plan to order some right now.A great alternative to greasy regular potato chips.

It's the only low-fat chip that gave me the same "crunch" as my favourite (super unhealthy) alternative - Kettle chips. I just ordered these last week, and my oh my, I think this is my favourite flavour now! Since I'm vegetarian, the BBQ flavour doesnt appeal to me, but I'm dying to try the Garlic Parm & Sour Cream and Onion... and OH, the cheddar ones are on their way.. can't wait :D...

review/text: Well the main thing here is that you are trading oil for starch. I found that it had a slightly funny taste at first, but the salt and vinegar flavors are true to form so its a very workable substitute for oily chips. When I eat chips I tend to eat them for the salty flavor, not the oil.

review/text: I love these Barbecue flavored Pop Chips. They're crunchy, loaded with spicy Barbecue flavor, and highly addicting. Beware... you're going to want more! After trying these you'll find it hard to believe they're pretty healthy. Go to their website and see for yourself (not every product page lists ingredients, it's worth checking it out). I'll definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />4 stars instead of 5 because although they're absolutely delicious, they're also inconsistent. One bag has different textured chips (and coating variances, mainly color difference) from another. That's fine with me but it's just a a little off putting.

I said I promise you will love these. When we got home I opened the bag and handed it to them. They loved them. When they returned home I got a call from my parents telling me they went to every healthy store around and no one sells them. I sent a case to their home since you can not get them on the east coast and they are almost finished with them. Time to order another case. BEST CHIPS EVER. We keep many bags in the house.

review/summary: ADDICTIVE
review/text: After years of being addicted to Smart Puffs, as soon as I tried these Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, I was an instant convert.<br /><br />They are light, crispy, and perfectly salty and vinegar-y.<br /><br />I think they taste amazing, however, my husband can't eat these chips because they make his eyes water. I *love* vinegar (I could drink the stuff if it wouldn't kill my stomach) so I don't understand how he's not obsessed with these chips (he likes the BBQ the best...). I guess if you're sensitive to vinegar-y tastes, this may not be the chip to you.<br /><br />However, if you LOVE Vinegar, like I do, these chips will pretty much take over your life as your favorite food. I sneak them all day. And they aren't terribly bad for you (12 grams of fat in a large bag), so if you overindulge, you won't have to add an extra mile to your workout the next day. However, you will get a raw tongue.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some of the bags are a little overcooked, and the chips are a light brown instead of golden colored. But they still taste the same, and are far and above any other Salt-and-Vinegar chip I have ever tried, including the ones that are terribly bad for you.

review/text: Let me start by saying that I have purchased Popchips for several years. I was even on Amazon autoship for 2 boxes every 2 months because we enjoyed them so much. That being said, I have been very disappointed with the last 2 shipments received. The barbeque had little to no seasoning on both boxes of both shipments. Not to.mention that the bags are now half filled with air. The bad thing about this is that both shipments came from different plants. I was so dissapointed with this last batch that I attempted to return them, but Amazon does not accept food returns. I have canceled both autoships and I won't buy them again until I am assured that this problem has been corrected. LISTEN UP POPCHIPS: YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS WANT THE PRODUCT THAT WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO CONSUMMING. IF I WANTED ORIGINAL FLAVOR CHIPS I WOULD HAVE ORDERED THEM. I WANT MY BARBEQUE CHIPS TO TASTE LIKE BARBEQUE. YOU HAVE LOST A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER WITH YOUR COST CUTTING EFFORTS :(

review/summary: super super yummy chips, minus the guilt -- Salt & Pepper
review/text: These Popchips are my absolute favorite. I love Popchips because they are super-crispy and light. They're air-popped instead of fried or baked and all-natural. You can pronounce all the ingredients on the list. Vegan, kosher, gluten-free, no cholesterol, no saturated fat, no trans-fats, low sodium (220mg or 6% USRDA), no preservatives or artificial flavors and colors, there's nothing in here for me to complain about.<br /><br />1 bag is only 100 calories (30 from fat), which is about 1/3 less than regular potato chips. I could eat the whole thing without feeling guilty. The salt and pepper taste is very pronounced and adds a really nice bite to the chips. When I was done, I found myself running my finger through the inside to pick up the remaining seasoning bits and crumbs.<br /><br />I've tried the BBQ flavor as well as several of the others. This one is my favorite. Highly highly recommended.

review/text: Oh, these chips are wonderful. They are not greasy, have a very satisfying crunch and although they are formed chips, they taste like actual potato chips. Only one grocery store in my area carries these chips and they are frequently out of stock, even at $3 a bag. Worse, even when in stock, I am lucky to find more than a few bags at a time in the store. I hate making the special trip just for the chips, particularly when I often find the shelf empty. Problem solved -- Amazon's are much more reasonably priced and I can stock up -- and this snack is as close in flavor to actual potato chips that I've found to date.

review/text: I am surprised just how yummy these chips are and my kids ADORE them. They have no artificial anything which is important as my kids are on the Feingold diet which eliminates all artificial coloring, preservatives, and flavors. The only thing that kept me from a higher star rating is the choice of oil they used to coat the chips. I have NO PROBLEM with oil as I believe fat is GOOD for us and the great thing is they coat the chips with oil AFTER they heat them so they don't create free radicals. That said, the ingredient list says, "sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil." Hmmmm... that's not very definitive!<br /><br />Sunflower and safflower oil are good but canola is a FRANKENFOOD that I don't want my kids to eat. Sigh... a yummy possibility spoiled by canola oil.

review/summary: Good alternative to potato chips, but very salty!
review/text: After sampling a bag of Pop Chips, I was excited about buying a large box from Amazon and stocking up on these healthy but tasty snacks. The chips themselves are a bit airy and they kind of dissolve in your mouth after you crunch into them, and they pack a lot of flavor! However, after the first couple of bags, I found the flavor was overwhelming and that the aftertaste was a bit too salty for my taste. The product itself is good, but the quantity was just too much for our household! Be sure you can eat 12 bags of these chips before they go stale, or just stick to buying one bag at a time at your local grocery store.

The chips are not gross. They taste like sweet potatos which to me means they need some butter flavor added  to make them taste good.  As it stands, they taste like an unflavored bake potatoe without any butter.<br /><br />I tried to eat a whole bag and they kept getting stuck in my teeth so I gave up.  Also, it just doesn't feel right to be eating sweet potato chips.  I have a whole box of them so I am going to continue to try to get used to them.<br />====<br /><br />Update: I still have a box of these chips left.  I couldn't stomach them, my co-workers said they were too bland, and my friend co-worker said they taste like unflavored cornflakes.<br /><br />I don't see how these will be a hit in stores.

review/summary: A little bland
review/text: I thought these were going to be sliced sweet potato's, but they are not part of the ingredients. It's actually sweet potato flour. In addition, there is rice flour and corn flour mixed in. I think the taste of the corn flour overpowers the sweet potato flavor. Overall, the chips taste like salty corn flakes with a hint of sweet potato.  Overall, probably fairly healthy for what they are (low in fat), but short on taste. If you are not expecting a strong sweet potato flavor, then these may be a good choice for you.

review/text: Finally! I can indulge in a crunchy, tasty snack that I won't regret an hour later. My favorite is the sea salt and vinegar flavor -- not too much vinegar, and just the right amount of salt. (The plain Pop Chips are solid, too.) These chips are unbelievably light. They give me the same satisfaction as munching on popcorn, but with less guilt and hassle.

review/text: The name of this flavor sounds fantastic, and I wondered why they didn't include them in their multi-flavor assortment. Then I tasted them. These chips are terrible, there is no parmesan flavor to speak of, and they somehow messed up the garlic as well. Avoid these and the also-no-incuded-assortment flavor of "jalapeno". Very disappointed.<br /><br />The cheddar, vinegar & salt and peppered flavors are FANTASTIC!

Very light, flavored, spicy. The texture on the chips look good, but the after taste is not that great. That was my review. But a couple of my colleagues liked them so much that they had 2 bags of it at once. they loved the taste, flavor and also the after taste. 100 cal per bag with 0 cholesterol, not a bad bet!

review/text: I love chips of all root vegetables-beets, potatoes, parsnips, carrots etc.  I love potato popchips had never tried the sweet potato version. I wasn't sure if the texture of pop chips and the sweet potato flaver would work together.<br /><br />I liked and enjoyed them but they aren't a flavor I would have as my 'go to' snack. I think for sweet potato I prefer real veggie slices.  These are light, crunchy, a little sweet and a little salty and perfect for times when you crave both sweet and salty. They are only 100 calories per bag and they came 24 bags in a nicely packed in a box. Great for lunches, or to keep in the car/desk/purse for a little pick me up snack.

review/summary: Yummy goodies!  But are they any healthier?
review/text: Yum! Yum!  I liked these and they are certainly yummy chips.  They are a tad sweet and a tad salty mixed.  I guess they are more sweet than salty, though. Why only four stars?  These are like Pringles or Munchos in that they take mashed potato product (in this case, sweet potato), and form them into shapes and bake (excuse me, "pop") them.  I would have liked these better (and they would be more healthy) had they been from whole sweet potatoes and then chipped and baked. Most of the good nutritional value of the Sweet Potato has been lost, I would imagine.  Still, a tastey treat that is certainly not terribly bad for you!  :)

review/text: The first time I tried this I thought, wow, this is great! It's as satisfying as eating regular potato chips, but sweeter and presumably healthier. So had I written the review then I would have given it 5 stars. The reason I hesitated was that I took it with me to work, and the more I tried it, the more I began to question the sweetness. There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars. It is still quite good, but if you find sweetness to be cloying, you might not like this product for long. But all in all, I would still recommend it.

review/summary: I loved them!
review/text: I am always looking for healthy, low calorie snacks, so when I heard about Popchips, I was intrigued.  They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.  This would be a great addition to a sandwich for lunch, or an in-between meal snack.  I am happy to add Popchips to my snack rotation.

review/summary: The crunch has it!
review/text: We frequent Whole Foods and love to buy the larger "Pop Chips" that they make. They are about 7 inches across and so unbelievable crispy! We like to eat them more for fun than anything.<br /><br />So when I was offered a chance to try these PopChips, I was excited. The size of each chip is about that of a potato chip. The bag is 100 calories (3 Weight Watchers +Points if you are calculating).<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is the sweet, followed by salty of the chip. Second is the crunch that is oh-so satisfying! My 5 year old just loved them while my 8 year old wasn't so hip to the flavor.<br /><br />There is a distinct sweet potato flavor, where the sweet comes in. There are also some other spices that I can't place, but the taste is not spicy hot, is considerably salty. I like them a lot and will continue to buy them to satisfy that late night or mid afternoon need for a crispy, salty snack.

review/text: I discovered Popchips when I was on a trip to Vegas.  I doubted I could find them when I got home and I was almost right.  I found a couple of stores that had them but only one flavor and the price was exhorbitant.  I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  They are low fat, low calorie, and still delicious.  The single serve bags are ideal for lunch or to throw in the car when on a short trip.

review/summary: Healthy really?
review/text: I was excited to buy these "chips" and try them out since they are supposed to be a healthier alternative. But these things are super super salty.  What it lacks in oil, it makes up for in salt.  I would not consider these things healthy at all.  I bought these for my toddler but I didn't know why he only ate 2 pieces before giving up until I tasted them myself. I even opened a 2nd and 3rd bag just to make sure the first bag wasn't just a fluke.  Don't waste your money on these.  Stick w/ the baked chips!

review/summary: Lacks flavor
review/text: Because I like sweet potatoe fries, I thought I would like these.  But, I found them to lack flavor.  There is just a bit of a bitter taste to them.  They may be better for you than potato chips, but they just don't give the same satisfaction.  However, they are not very salty and are in a 100 calorie pack which makes them healthier for you. I thought maybe it was just me, so I had my husband and sister try them.  They each gave them a 2.5 rating.  My sister said they were a bit bland.  Hubby said they weren't too bad.  But, none of us are excited about eating another bag.

review/summary: A nice alternative
review/text: I shared these with friends at work.  The consensus is that they taste good, if not quite what some people expected.  Those who enjoy sweet potato fries liked them better than those with no experience in that area.  Price would be a consideration for everyone who tasted these, but not necessarily the overriding issue.  I personally enjoy them.  I'd look for them in a larger bag over a snack-size bag, mostly because I'm cheap that way.  Nobody said they were nasty or that it was something they'd never choose.

review/summary: WAY better than I expected
review/text: The label says they're popped, rather than fried or baked.  However they did it, these are great chips!  They're very nicely seasoned such that I don't think you'd be inclined to dip them, though they're certainly sturdy enough to.  The flavor is a nice balance sweet and salty with not too much of either. At 100 calories a bag, 3 grams of fat (no saturated, no trans fat), 16g carbohydrates and 230mg sodium per bag they're also great nutritionally.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but in this form they are terrific!  All five of us in this house from age 9 to 50-something are fans.<br /><br />I wish I was better at describing flavors but you'll just need to try them for yourself.

Every time I eat these chips I feel like I am taking a whiff of the old codger's rear, and it brings back memories. Sometimes I just open up a bag and deeply inhale the crotchety old aroma. Scottyboy and I eat these by the dozens, and I requested them so much that ol Scottyboy, who's in charge of snack purchases, bought these in bulk, which makes up for the week he bought ten boxes of edible strawberry underwear for the office.

We do not like the dry and more on the salty taste of these chips. I will no longer make purchases on items that I can try buying at the store first before investing in buying by bulk and saving online. Do not purchase these chips unless you already tried them before.

review/text: I like all kinds of snack foods and potato chips. The regular kind, kettle cooked, and the "modified" potato snacks such as Munchos (my favorite) Pringles, Lay's Baked, etc.<br /><br />But not these. They have almost a styrofoam consistency...so they aren't really crisp and snappy, just hard. Like stale styrofoam. Now, I could learn to live with the texture, but the flavor is odd, too. . Almost like an unnatural type of flavor. My husband doesn't even usually notice or comment on flavors in snack foods(just sorta eats,) but he said "I don't like these, they taste funny. Don't buy these again." My 12 year old kids wouldn't even eat them. Maybe the ones with flavoring (like BBQ) cover it up, but not with the plain.

review/text: I understand many people love these things, but I bought the sea salt and vinegar popchips and I hated them. I LOVE regular  potato chips lay's and other brands. These popchips not only taste bad but they have a bad after taste to me.<br />I think these popchips must be for "heath" type people who try to convince themselves these taste good.<br />We like what we like and we all have different experiences about this type of thing.<br />After reading so many positive reviews I thought these would be good.<br />They taste "hallow", "empty", too artificial chemical taste.<br />With a regular potato chip I get the "that's it" sensation, satisfying, full flavor.

review/summary: Dissappointing
review/text: To quote another reviewer, I can't understand the high praises these chips have been receiving.<br /><br />Based on their popularity and high review score I ordered the 6-flavor variety pack off of Amazon. With some excitement I tore open the packaging and tried the various flavors. I was met with disappointment. Texture-wise, these chips are not crunchy at all and are unsatisfying. The flavors vary from terrible to passable. I couldn't finish the pack of what they call "salt and vinegar" chips.<br /><br />I suppose these chips might be popular with people who are trying to watch their weight.<br /><br />An anecdote: the day after I received these I gave the rest away to the other people in my dorm (who proceeded to affirm my suspicions that these chips were subpar). I then went to the corner shop across the street and bought some salt & vinegar Kettle chips.

review/text: I'm a big fan of Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, so my daughter decided to surprise me with these new Popchips.  I really like the different texture...light, tender, and crisp.  The salt and vinegar taste is strong and tangy but not overwhelming.  I like the individual packages, because I actually stop eating when I finish a bag.<br /><br />In each bag there are about 18 large chips, 3 grams of fat (not bad!), 100 calories, 15 g of carbohydrates, 140 mg of salt, and no cholesterol.  They are vegan friendly, parve (no meat or dairy), and gluten free.<br /><br />The package says they are healthier because they are not fried and they are tastier because they are not baked.  They use heat and pressure to "pop" the potatoes into light and airy (my description) chips.<br /><br />Finally, these packages have a "use by" date of nearly a year, much longer than regular chips.

Since we are a big fan of Jalapeno, we went ahead and ordered them here at Amazon,even though the price was high, and we regret that purchase, the Jalapeno flavor is just wrong. Awful would be the right description. We also tried the Cheddar and that on also failed badly for us. So, we will stick to the BBQ and the Orginals.

review/summary: I still like potato chips, but these are surprisingly delicious! Airy! Crispy!
review/text: These Popchips are delicious! The best thing I like about them is that they're crunchy and airy with a perfect blend of chili and lime flavoring. I love the boldness of the chili and tartness of the lime! Each chip appears to me like two thin potato chips sealed together with air inside! That might be a bit fanciful, but that's how it feels when I bite into one. They satisfy my taste buds and I get an extra jolt from the airiness and crunchiness.<br /><br />What else can I say, except: Yum! Yum! And, oh, yes, with all-natural ingredients and only 100 calories for the entire bag, my Dr. approves them too.<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, February 22, 2012<br />Author of "Dream Reachers" series of books (with Chase Von)

review/summary: Light and delicious
review/text: These are little airy and delicious nuggets of goodness...except of course, they aren't nuggets, lol. Really though, these chips are nice and crunchy while also being light and airy. The salt and vinegar flavor is just right...not too strong, but never lacking. Actually, my only real complaint is that i find it difficult to stop eating them. However, that is simply my cross to bear.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Great crispy crunch and flavor
review/text: My family is addicted to crispy, salty snacks and I've tried a few different kinds of chips trying to find a healthier alternative to the junk food they all love.<br /><br />I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DZIL24">Terra Krinkle Cut Sweet Potato Sea Salt</a> chips for their high level of vitamin A. But they are also high fat, and the texture and flavor don't appeal to my daughter.<br /><br />These chips don't have any vitamin A according the to the label, but they are low calorie, low fat and low sodium. The texture and flavor are a definite hit with everyone in my family, even my very picky daughter.<br /><br />The sweet potato chips aren't too sweet or too salty and they don't feel greasy at all. They are really crisp. The flavor is a little bland, but it also doesn't have the aftertaste that some vegetable chips can have.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the chips is rice flour, not sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I'd like these better if they had more going for them nutritionally. The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber, vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon. I think they would be a wonderful topping for casseroles if they stay crispy enough.

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these "chips" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's "good" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.

review/text: I really liked these.  Great snack for someone watching their fat and or calorie intake.  Light, crunchy and full of flavor.  They don't taste like a traditional chip they seem infused with air or something.  The biggest problem for me would be if I bought the large bag I would be too tempted to eat way more than a serving.  So these single sized bags are ideal.<br /><br />Also should mention that the sweet potato variety that I tried do not contain any dairy which is a necessity for me and I'm sure others have similar issues.

review/text: After reading several reviews from people apparently on diets I now understand the high star rating because if you can't have the real thing something like this passes for good. These are bland, have a weird texture and aren't very good. I will be sending these to work with my husband so he can give them away. I ate a few from my first and only bag before throwing them in the pantry. They are low in calories and low in taste. Pass.

review/summary: Chili Lime Flavor - Review
review/text: In general, I love Popchips.  (BBQ are my absolute favs.)  These are the chips I go for automatically at the store because of their crisp texture and great taste.<br /><br />This review is for the Chili Lime Popchips.<br /><br />They have a little heat for the Chili and a bit of acid for the Lime, however, I must admit that these are not my favorite.  The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.  Not awful.  Not great.  Not on my shopping list.

review/summary: Keep Popping!
review/text: The crisp texture of these PopChips is very appealing.  The chips also stayed whole in the bag, which is a big plus.  They  have a nice sweet potato flavor, with a light hint of salt.  Best of all, no greasy fingers!  I like that they are a healthy alternative to other chips or crackers.  The information on the bag well represents the taste of the chips.  I think that children would like these and they would certainly be a healthy alternative to other chips.  They are also gluten free...which seems to be a growing trend in foods today.  Overall, I would definitively buy these chips again and look forward to trying other flavors of Popchips.

review/summary: Satisfies a sweet potato tooth
review/text: Sweet potatoes are among my favorite vegetables, and I especially adore sweet potato chips. So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth.

review/summary: A healthier snack
review/text: We got the sweet potato flavor through the Vine program.  I was genuinely surprised by how good these were.  Crunchy but light texture.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake "healthier" for "healthy."  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those "truth in advertising" points that annoys me so I mention it.

review/summary: Fabulous Taste - can't eat just one but small warning
review/text: These are absolutely delicious and irresistable. The taste is perfect - not heavy or overdone. It actually kind of sneaks up on you before you realize you've just finished the bag.<br /><br />They seem to melt in your mouth even as you are chewing them as opposed to some brands that make you feel like Mr. Ed (the horse). Yes,there is some salt, but it's not like someone just dumped a container of the stuff on them. This time it enhances the chip.<br /><br />Everything in them is terrific except for the inclusion of maltodextrin about 2/3 down the ingredient list. It can have a kind of laxative effect on a lot of people and I just thought you should know it's in there.<br /><br />Other than that - there is nothing about this product that would detract me from buying it for parties, picnics, events, or just enjoying by myself.<br /><br />Seriously, they are that good.

review/text: Advertised as an all natural, gluten free,healthier snack, we tried the BBQ & Sour Cream & Onion flavors.  We have a slight preference for the BBQ over the Sour Cream & Onion because the BBQ has a little more flavor. However, both leave a slightly strange aftertaste shortly after consuming a single serving bag.<br /><br />The chip crunch is great and adds to the satisfaction of eating the chip.<br /><br />Overall, a nice snack.  For flavor; however, we prefer Veggie Chips.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041BSZGA">Sensible Portions Veggie Snacks Variety - 24 Bags</a> (especially the Rosemary flavored straws).

review/text: I didn't realize I was getting 20 packets of these chips but I was happy to see them when they arrived.  I love anything sweet potato so I opened the box eagerly and started chowing down.  They are delicious!  My only concern is that I don't really like the texture of anything "popped" but because the flavor is delicious I can overlook that.  These chips would work perfectly with many diet plans.  They are very crispy and although you won't confuse them with "real" chips they will satisfy that urge for something crunchy.  I'm going to buy them in several other flavors to keep on hand.

review/summary: Once again, America's food scientists bring us a new snack!
review/text: POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO is a crunchy potato chip, that is not your grandfather's potato chip.  First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.  I have no negative comments about the POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO product.

review/summary: Taste more like "Tomato and Basil" than "Chili and Lime"
review/text: NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're "probably" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a "tomato" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like "Tomato and Basil" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.

review/text: I love potato chips.  I could eat them by the bagful but thanks to the powers that be, this would not provide anyone with enough nutrition to survive.  Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.

I received lots of compliments on the overall theme of the party and the favors!  Would definitely buy again!

review/summary: super fun 'typical' treat found in Japanese convenience stores
review/text: We moved about a year ago, and I found this treat was in stock with a third party Amazon seller and just had to buy some!  My kiddos used to get these on occasion in the various flavors (caramel, coffee I think, strawberry) but of course the chocolate was their favorite.  Hard to describe--little chunks of possibly rice based treat with the chocolate flavoring and coating.  I should know, but I don't.  Very typical treat and my kids love that they can get them once in awhile.<br /><br />As I mentioned, these are not from Amazon itself so if you are shopping do check the vendor out.  The vendor of today may not be the same as the one tomorrow.  In this case the price was reasonable and the shipping reasonable enough to justify the fun surprise when my sons get the mail.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those missing their Circle-K/7-11 treats!<br /><br />JTG

When it arrived I was showing someone the label ingredients and was amazed at the changes on the label.......very disappointed that I now had 6 bottles of a salad dressing I could not use since I am already on a low salt diet.  Had called the company and they said they had changed the recipe and no longer had that particular one......too bad!  It was very low fat, sodium and no sugar yet had an excellent taste.

review/summary: Wonderful cat food
review/text: My old cat who died last year had diabetes because I didn't understand the basic principles of feline nutrition. After he was diagnosed, I switched him to a canned food diet with multiple small feedings per day, and that was actually enough to get him off insulin!<br /><br />Although I would have done anything to prevent his diabetes, I didn't appreciate how unfussy it made him until he died and I got another cat. The old cat would eat anything. The new cat would starve himself to death before he'd eat something that doesn't meet his standards.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's particularly fussy about canned food. He doesn't like pate-style or ground foods - if I even want there to be a prayer of him eating it, it has to have shredded meat. That's why I was so pleased to discover this brand.<br /><br />First of all, I love the ingredient list. The foods are balanced and grain-free (so important!) and don't contain unnecessary chemicals or preservatives. The only ingredient I'm less than thrilled about is the tapioca starch (used for thickening), but it's listed after the protein sources I really don't worry about it. When I was first considering this brand, I checked out reviews for it on other websites, and there were a lot of people upset that some of the flavors contain menadione. I looked into this, and it's a form of vitamin K which is an essential additive in fish-based foods because they don't contain enough natural vitamin K and it's required for health. The controversy appears to be based in that it was banned for humans...after a bunch of babies died when they were given great big whopping doses. Fortunately, the amount of menadione added is so minuscule that I'm totally comfortable with its inclusion. (And since it's not present in the chicken-based formulas, and since I think poultry is a better staple food for cats than fish, he gets that much less of it.)<br /><br />Actually, the chicken and pumpkin flavor seems to be his favorite. I was a little unsure of using pumpkin, since cats are carnivores and carbohydrates can have some bad effects, but it's apparently good for their digestion. Since I rotate the different flavors, the possible consequences are really reduced...and since cats seem to like to barf just to keep things interesting, I'm pleased about any possible stabilizing effect!<br /><br />Soulistic's website also promises to use human-grade ingredients. No by-products here! It even smells like regular people food, which, let me tell you, is a welcome relief.<br /><br />But the best part: the cat loves it. He doesn't refuse it, he's not even merely indifferent to it - he devours it. I've tried every single flavor of the "in gravy" flavors (I haven't tried the "in gelee" flavors) and every single one of them sends him into raptures.<br /><br />Seriously, it doesn't get any better than this. There's a canned grain-free cat food with a high moisture content and shreds or chunks of real meat and fish as the first ingredients, and the cat loves it. There are enough flavors to give him variety, both in taste and nutrition. I'm sold!

review/text: I wish my cats would eat this. One cat will lick up all the liquid, eat some of the shredded chicken but not all. Bummer cause this is the cleanest canned cat food I've come across. From the smell you'd never think this was a cat food.<br /><br />Unfortunately Petco only had the Good Karma Chicken Dinner Adult Canned Cat Food in Gravy (.99 per can) or I would have gotten all of their offerings.<br /><br />I've recently taken in (or been taken in by) a stray and he will not eat anything but Safeway's Mom-to-Mom chicken baby food, and California Natural Chicken and brown rice dry. Weird and totally frustrating. Which is how I came across this Soulistic btw.<br /><br /> My other cat has been getting real finicky for the past couple of yrs.

review/summary: Excellent odor control and soft on the paws!
review/text: I bought one bag each of the micro crystals and the Pearl crystals by Ultra Pet.  Having used Fresh Step Crystals since my two cats joined the family over a year ago, I didn't want to shock them with the switch so I tried the Pearls first as they are larger crystals.  I layered the Pearls with a thin carpet of Fresh Step crystals and they seemed to take to it well enough.  The odor control was equivalent (superb) to Fresh Step which is a big thumbs up from me and the two "boys".<br /><br />After finishing that bag, I went to the Micro Crystals.  Before I could even start to put a layer of the Fresh Step on top, one of the cats leaped into the box and basically started dancing around in the litter.  I don't know if it's because of the sand-like quality compared to the hard, rough crystals but he was literally having a ball just spinning around in the box.  I guess it took his brother shoving him out to go do his business for the first one to figure out it's not to play in!<br /><br />All in all, both products I tried were superb quality and highly absorbent with long lasting odor control.  I'll be purchasing the Micro Crystals because it's easier on MY feet considering they do tend to throw this all over the floor before they "go".  It's unfortunate that there's a 3 week shipping delay and there's no subscribe & save option.  If not for those issues, I would make the full switch over to Ultra Pet litters.

I pay 8.99 regular price at Publix or $7.99 on sale.  I never see coupo buy in th paper offered by the vendor.  But, I am willing to pay the higher price.  Amazon's price is ridiculous.  Wish I could buy it in bulk.  But 8.99 for a full month is fine, too.  I change the box, and my air filter every month when I pay by mortgage.  This way , I never forget either.  Whether you buy the Pearls or the Micro is a matter of your cats' preference, as both work equally as well.

review/text: I consider this litter easy because it lasts about 2 weeks for two of my cats. I only have to rake it during those two weeks, then I clean the entire box with detergent, get out the new bag of litter, and I'm done!  The other important part of this litter is that I can flush the poop in the toliet.  Ultra Pearls cat litter is the only crystal, long lasting, litter out there where you can do that--vs. having to put it in a trashbag where it can get awfully stinky!  Anything that makes my life easier, and less smelly is a great thing!

There can be a tracking issue, but that has not been a deal-breaker for me. I was paying anywhere from $7.99 to $9.99 per five-pound bag on any given week, which I thought was excessive but worth it. I feel I'm being punished for my loyalty by needing to order this now that my grocery store no longer stocks it. $16.89/5-lb. bag. Seriously? Why so much higher than a grocery store?

review/summary: Working great
review/text: After fighting with the clumps sticking to the bottom of my Littermaid so that it was constantly in need of scooping/scraping and re-starting, I thought I'd try this litter even though the Littermaid specifically says not to use it. Wonder why? Maybe because you will not need to keep buying their receptacles?<br /><br />Just like when using a clumping litter, you have to be careful to keep the level of the litter at 1-2", but it is a LOT easier with this stuff because you don't have to constantly replenish it. Just dump it once per month (for one cat) and replace it with new.<br /><br />It is odorlessly absorbing the urine and I haven't dad to deal with a single bit of solid waste as there are no more clumps preventing the rake from doing its work and the receptacle (lined with a plastic bag) does not need emptying every day.<br /><br />Every time I pass by the box it is clean and fresh for my kitty. I give it a stir once per day according to the directions, but no more sifting and scraping.

review/summary: love it!
review/text: This is hands down the best cat litter I've ever used.  The mini crystals don't clump up and get stuck to the bottom of the tray. It's super absorbent and doesn't stink. I have used Tidy cats Crystals which they don't make anymore. That was the reason I tried World's Best Cat litter which is SO NOT the best. Very stinky after 3 days.  Then I did some googling and came across this brand. I bought it based on customer feedback. I highly recommend it as well and I will never use another brand!

review/summary: Very good odor control, pleasant texture & appearance
review/text: PROS:  good odor control, little dust, pleasant appearance, tracking is decent and the smooth crystals don't hurt little paws or bare feet.<br /><br />CONS:  expensive, can't find this brand in any stores nearby if I run out and with two kitties (one with chronic diarrhea), I tend to use A LOT so it adds up in cost.<br /><br />Since getting my kitties a few months ago I've tried several different litters and am happiest with Ultra Pearls (smooth shape).  They are expensive, but that is the price I'm willing to pay for good odor control AND easier scooping, cleaner tracking.  The best odor control was with Fresh Step scoopable clay litter...but it nearly requires a jack-hammer to dislodge the clumps from the bottom of the litter box and from your scoop...plus it looks messy like dirt when it tracks outside.<br /><br />Even though Ultra Pearls are slightly less effective at odor control than Fresh Step, they are still a satisfactory "second place" in that department.  Regarding tracking, I want to add that I prefer the smooth crystals to the "jagged" because if you have ever stepped on a "jagged" crystal litter accidentally in your bare feet...well, you will understand why I prefer smooth crystals!<br /><br />I order with auto-refill for extra discount.

review/text: I have purchased just about every brand and type of cat litter available over the years.  This is the best one.  It lasts the longest.  Far outlasts any other I have used.  It actually smells good.  And it maintained a good odor for at least a month.  Of course, I only have one cat.  But, I have always hated the litter box.  Seems like I could smell "something" even after I had just cleaned it. I have been so happy with this purchase!

I got rid of it this a.m. and I can still smell it, even on my clothes!<br />This litter is also made in China which doesn't exactly have a great track record with our pets.<br />I have since found a benign safe litter- Feline Fresh- which smells of pine and hopefully won't hurt my cats or us.<br />It also doesn't cut down any trees in the process.<br /> It's a win-win!  And it is made in the USA.<br /> Update: Feline Fresh is too dusty!<br /> Have switched to Feline Pine.<br /><br />The bottom line:  Just sticking with the pine litter, my cat has stopped coughing!!!

review/text: I've been using this crystal for about 8 months for my cat.  He's never been picky about his sand, and this is no exception.  It's the only reasonably priced crystal litter on Amazon that I can find for subscribe-and-save, which is the reason I decided to try it.  I would prefer a coarser grain crystal (easier to clean, less tracking) but this works fine.<br /><br />I love crystal cat litter because of its amazing odor-control.  The extra you pay for crystal is more than made up for by the fact that you don't have to change it as often.

review/summary: The best cat litter ever!
review/text: I tried this cat litter on a whim while I was living in FL.  I purchased it on sale at Publix.  I can not say enough about how great it is.  I think the best part is the 'tracking'.  With all the other cat litters I have tried, both crystal and clay, it drove me crazy stepping on pieces of litter everywhere I went.  With the Ultra Pet Ultra Micro Crystals, there is minimal tracking...and when it is tracked out of the litter box, the crystals are so tiny!  No more stepping on big pieces of cat litter!<br /><br />I do only have one cat, and have closely monitored how long this cat litter lasts.  I also have the electronic cat litter box, so I do not need to 'stir it up', like I would if it wasn't electronic.  This cat litter definitely lasts for 1 month, and I have found at times, I can almost push it to 5 weeks.<br /><br />And now for the best part.....Amazon now has this on 'subscription' pricing!  I pick when I would like it shipped and I get it for a cheaper price than buying it in the store, AND it is FREE SHIPPING!  I set it up for a bag a month to be delivered (wow, I will never be running to the grocery store to get cat litter!) but can change it, if I find its not working.<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAT LITTER!!!!  I can not say enough about it!

review/summary: Fantastic litter for sifting boxes!
review/text: I tried crystal litter years ago, and wasn't impressed. I ended up with a soupy wet mess with an awful urine odor. Either they've gotten a lot better since then, or this product is simply better than what I tried back then. Either way, I'm thrilled!<br /><br />I love the size of the bag. One bag of litter is just right for my sifting litter box, and lasts 2.5 weeks on average with my two cats. When it's time to change the litter, I can tell because it doesn't absorb as well, and I end up having to scrape wet litter off the bottom of the box while sifting. When the litter is fresh, sifting the box is super quick and effortless.<br /><br />The litter does a great job at controlling odors. As for tracking...if you're looking for a litter that doesn't track at all, good luck! Any litter you use is going to track a little bit. I use a mat about twice the size of the box, and that catches most of the spillage. I still end up with a little area around the mat that I have to vacuum or sweep regularly, but I don't ever find litter scattered through the rest of the house like I did with pine or clumping clay litters.

review/text: I have found a litter that I can live with. I have a 12lb, 14 year old ragdoll. Not only is he a big boy but he refuses to walk out of his litter box, he jets out. His jetting out would cause a spray of litter to fly out with him. This product stays inside the litter box. He also has to most foul smelling urine you could imagine. The clay litter would keep the smell away for about a week. This stuff is amazing, I put in my first bag about 3 weeks ago and my house still does not smell like urine. I am very happy with this product and will continue to purchase it.

review/summary: Long-lasting!
review/text: I was hooked on another (#1) kitty litter but due to high customer demand (or poor planning) it is periodically unavailable just when I need another order. I don't like the store brands-- either Petsmart or Petco-- so tried two bags of the Ultra Pearls (free shipping!). Not only does my 6 year old Manx like it, 1-5 lb. bag lasts about 4-6 weeks using a small litter box (which my small kitty prefers). I have to have the box in the living room (behind some plants as camouflage) because she doesn't like going downstairs (as the surprises on the fireplace hearth attest). I have been pleasantly surprised that the smell is very well covered (a few minutes when it's fresh, occasionally one can smell); I pick up solid waste with a saved grocery baggie and throw away. No smell and the crystals seem to last forever! Although she's small she has very healthy movements.... although the other brand is less expensive, I definitely had to use the entire bag every 2 weeks (at most). For me, $35 for two bags of the Ultra is well worth it. No urine smell even after several weeks; the crystals become opaque so this indicates a change of litter is necessary. I bought and used the 1st 5-lb. bag around December 6th and just poured the last half of the bag yesterday into the box after throwing out the old litter. Additionally, there is very little tracking as opposed to the larger crystals which I am constantly sweeping up. For my small kitty (6 lbs) this is perfect. For larger cats or multiple cats this may not be as cost effective but may be worth a try.

review/text: I've finally found the perfect cat litter - at least as far as I'm concerned.  A bit high in price but cheaper in the long run as I've paid more for crystals which have only lasted 1 week per refill whereas I am already on week 3 and there's no odor and it looks as fresh as it did when I put it in the box.  There is some minor tracking of the litter but that could be Ms Clean, aka Casey, pulling the litter out the entry way when she cleans up.  It extends perhaps a foot outside the entry way.  She seems very happy with it.  The clean up is very easy and I've only added a small amount so far.  That means I am still on the bag used to fill up the box.  I have already placed my refill orders.

There really is no smell, no dust and I haven't yet noticed any tracking!  It does seem sort of expensive because it's a small bag, but the one bag has lasted me a month now, with no need to add any to the box.  I thought it would maybe be inconvenient because it isn't flushable.  It's not because you don't have to scoop the pee.  Just a few #2 pieces.  I highly recommend this litter.

review/text: This product is just horrible. I have never had litter track this bad. It gets stuck in her paws and she tracked it all the way to my bedroom which is far away from the box. That has never happened with any other litter. It is also ball shaped, so combined with the tracking problem, they are all over the kitchen floor and what a pain it is to sweep it up. They just roll all around. You couldn't pay me to use this product again. I used it for one week and through the rest of the bag in the garbage.

In comparison Just the Crystals is $17.89 for 8.8 lbs and is pretty decent for the price.

review/summary: dusty and too light
review/text: The advantage of the micro crystals (more absorptive surface) is also it's biggest disadvantage.  The crystals are so small and light that they get tracked all over.  They also invariably get stuck in the crevasses of the cats' paws.  I am not sure whether these crystals contributed to the irritation of the paws on one of my cats.  Odor control is good until, all of a sudden, the crystals get saturated and the ammonia smell is almost impossible to get rid of.  I must say I like a natural clumping litter (like Swheat Scoop) better.

I thought this product would be a good substitute for Tidy Cats Crystals but it's essentially worthless. Very pretty packaging - very bad product :(

review/summary: Freeze Dried
review/text: I purchased the product because I am using the Medifast diet program and I had to stop drinking coffee.  I only want coffee when it is nearly white with cream; which is not conducive to a healthy diet.  The Medifast has shakes I use in the morning so I decided I could mix instant coffee with the shake and I would be getting the caffeine... very important!  I started using the Starbucks Via product (which is wonderful) but at $9.95 for 12 individual servings, it was getting very expensive.  I looked for something that would be comparable.  This is not a comparable product - the processing method used is completely different.  The product is inexpensive (I received 96 packets for $13.)  Essentially, I got 8 times the number of packets for about the same money.  This more than makes up for the difference in quality.  Besides, when it's a mix in, it's not the primary flavor.<br /><br />Pros: Great price, convenient perforated flip top<br />Cons: Freeze Dried (large crystals), wouldn't  use for stand alone cup of coffee<br />Summary: Great price for a coffee mix-in (shakes, etc.)

review/summary: Very Yummy Tea
review/text: I ordered this tea both for myself and as a gift (since it comes as a pack of 2).  The tea is packaged well for freshness, and it smells and tastes GREAT!  I recommend using 1.5 teaspoonfuls of tea to each 8 ounces of water, steep for 3.5 minutes.  I will definitely be reordering this tea once I start to get low on this batch.  Thanks, Octavia, for a great loose leaf tea product!

review/summary: The real thing!
review/text: I first had Monin Hazelnut syrup 20 years ago in a small coffee shop in Tacoma, WA. Fell in love, searched high and low to find it for home, and spent big bucks acquiring it off and on. Sometime along the way it quit tasting right so I quit using it. I gave the current Organic version a try and Lo, and Behold, it is the pure nutty fruity sweet taste I recall! Hurray! No more chemical aftertaste and not-hazelnut flavor!<br /><br />If you don't think you like nut-flavored syrups, but love hazelnuts, be sure to give this a try. I have also used it to make white chocolate hazelnut truffles!

review/summary: Five stars from the Husband
review/text: I am not a big hazelnut fan but I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  Loves it so much that he went through it in about 2 weeks.  Now, I am trying to decide if I should get more of the organic version or try the cheaper non-organic version.  My husband is pretty picky so I was surprised he liked this at all.  My sister in law also tried it and is now ordering it as well.  If you have a hazelnut lover in your midst, buy them this!<br /><br />Also, a side note.  For some reason when I ordered this, I never got it.  I contacted Sweetsauras and they promptly sent me another bottle.  Someone, somewhere is enjoying a lost in transit organic hazelnut monin bottle.  It will probably be the next person to leave a review (I'm watching for you!).<br /><br />If Sweetsaurus is reading this, I would like to request they set up a subscribe and save for this item.  I would gladly buy three to six bottles at a time!  I want to keep my husband happy.<br /><br />UPDATE:  the company listened to my request and made a listing for six bottles at a time.  THANK YOU!

review/text: I originally bought this at Cub Foods and was pleasantly surprised it did not make me feel sick at all. All other mayo's- even watered down make me nauseated or give me a stomach ache. I use it on my salads as a dressing and make chicken salad with it. I am wheat and dairy free and this is the greatest product ever- as I can now add to my menu-- items that need mayonnaise, dressing or sauce.<br />The only downer is the super small size, but since it is just me and my daughter using it, it's ok, and easy to take on vacation.

review/summary: yummy
review/text: i love fruit syrups on pancakes and waffles. plum syrup is impossible to find, so i was delighted to find this. the taste is rich and sweet/tart. you have to microwave the bottle for about 30 seconds before you use it, or it won't come out of the bottle. because the texture is like a thin jelly, it kind of "blops" out of the bottle instead of pouring easily. however, it melts quickly on your hot pancakes. i especially love it as a glaze on pork chops. the "blops" melt on the chops, and the excess is super in the pan to continually glaze the chops if you turn them several times to coat. i'll buy more again when i run out, only i'll buy more than one bottle at a time. i gave 4 stars instead of 5 because you must heat it to get it out, and it doesn't pour, it "blops". also i wish it was a larger size. it's now my favorite syrup, and i know you won't be at all disappointed in the flavor. mmmmm....

review/text: As the espresso roast blend is the one Starbucks stores use to base their drinks on including cappuccinos, frappuccinos and all other creations that customers demand on a daily basis.<br />This coffee is addictive and has a heady aroma and its caramelly sweetness comes through cup after cup and it is the perfect blend for a new coffee drinker to try. It is worth every penny and Starbucks "wouldn't pull a shot without it."<br />I even brew it straight up in my Bunn coffeepot for a nice rich pot of java that makes my morning a little more bearable.

review/summary: Bzzzzz...
review/text: I bought this tea because when summer rolls around, I am a little puddle of miserable. Seriously, my allergies attack with everything they've got and there are days where I simply cannot go outside. Last summer, I discovered green tea seemed to help with some of the symptoms, as did local honey. So when I spotted Bee Pollen Matcha, I had to try it, if only to keep on hand for when I make smoothies all summer. Mmmm smoothies. A little frozen fruit, a splash of tea, and I am in heaven. This is why I bought a blender!<br /><br />This is most likely a case of mind over matter, but the first few sips of this tasted like honey to me. I don't know if it actually does, it's not overwhelmingly sweet, but it tastes a touch like honey. Kind of like how Honeybee from DavidsTea tastes like...well, how you imagine a bee would taste. All bzzzz and the like. But it is sweet enough and flavorful enough that while I was drinking it at work, I kept reaching for it. I tend to place my travel mug on the corner of the desk and forget it's there until I lose my voice.<br /><br />This matcha is also a good addition to my smoothies, since it provides calcium and protein. As someone on a dairy-free diet, the ability to get calcium in my tea is very important to me. A friend of mine says that "drinking tea for the health benefits is like having sex for the exercise," but after a summer of allergies made manageable by local honey and green tea, I'm a believer. Do I think tea is going to magically make me skinner? No. Damn it. But I do firmly believe that teas like this matcha can help with things like allergies and vitamin deficiencies. If nothing else, this tea keeps me away from carbonated drinks like Coke and Dr. Pepper....mmm, Dr. Pepper. It also helps me cut back on sugary fruit juices and heart attack causing energy drinks. Matcha is all I need to get that rush to help me make it through my day. And this particular matcha is a tasty, tasty option. I love it! A sweet green tea that makes you feel like you're drinking something that will give you superpowers? That also helps you get your vitamins and bounce around your office like you just had a large can of Red Bull? Sign me up!

I have a whole can to eat up and I found rinsing and then drying them does help somewhat in getting the flavor off but I will not be purchasing again!

When they arrived, I realized that they were coated with something that included MSG! I was looking for a healthy snack, NOT MSG. The MSG was not mentioned before I made the purchase. I kept them, but I was not happy and I cancelled my subscription immediately. I would still like to arrange for some healthy nuts to arrive periodically by means of a subscription arrangement, but now I am very hesitant to sign up for it. Who would imagine that someone taking care to avoid oiled and salted almonds in favor of plain roasted ones would be pleased to get them coated with MSG??? Not me!

review/text: I really love these almonds. They have a delicious savory flavor; it's mild and sort of oniony.  These are my new favorite TV-watching-playing-on-the-computer snack.<br />I signed up for Amazon's Subscribe & Save, which is a very good deal.  Even Amazon's regular price is much better than the grocery store price.  Too bad they don't come in 12-packs; I go through 2-3 jars a week.

review/text: after major surgery and a restricted diet for awhile, it was suggested I add dry roasted almonds to my diet.  great idea! the light coating provides needed sodium and adds to the flavor without being overpowering.  my liquid diet no longer seems boring, and I've found it's easier to buy these on-line since local stores are always in short supply.  good product, many health advantages to almonds without overwhelming calories!

review/summary: My nuts shrunk!
review/text: Okay, I'll admit, I do want to be the only three star - that's just how I roll.  I am absolutely addicted to these nuts.  When I realized my habit was costing me $6 every few days I looked for alternatives.  Tada - Amazon.com!  A great value and the subscribe and save is "saving" me $10 every time I eat 4 cans (which takes about three weeks).  Anyway, I love them.  My ONLY complaint is that I think they are shipping a different grade of nut compared to the $6 can at the store - they are smaller.  After I eat my four cans, I always have to buy at least one more can to hold me over till the next shipment.  This is where I have noticed that the $6 nuts are bigger.  So that's my story, my nuts shrunk.  But I love em' anyway.

review/summary: I love them, but buy one jar at store before getting them in bulk
review/text: I find the flavor of these almonds to be wonderfully savory, the coating is barely covering the nut but really keeps them nice and crunchy.  I think the coating has the same flavor profile as old fashioned dry roasted peanuts, the slightly seasoned ones I remember my grandma always having a jar of.<br /><br />I guess these are really a love them or leave them type of product; you'll notice the very high or very low star ratings, not one 3 star review when I tasted these.  I think the split is because the almonds do not have the word "seasoned" in the title so people looking for plain almonds feel duped.  I also see that some people are mad about them containing MSG; it is listed clearly in the ingredient list so you can avoid it if you have problems consuming it.  Some people get sick or bad headaches so this is an important thing to be aware of if you are sensitive.<br /><br />I can see how someone would be put off by any flavor if they were looking for plain; my advice is to always hunt down the ingredient list to any food you are planning to buy without tasting first, especially if ordering in bulk.  I went to the grocery store and got one jar of these to see if I liked them, when these are gone I will be getting these in bulk here on amazon since I paid almost $6 for one jar.  Good flavor, good value.

review/text: Having tasted Emerald's dry roasted almonds for the first time, I felt the need to write this review to defend them. I think they taste delicious! Yes, they are seasoned, yes they have a hint of garlic, and yes they are salted, but these all make for a great combo of flavor. This was the first time I ever came across garlic being used to with almonds, and I think it really complements the nuts well. However, I must confess that I am a garlic fiend, and so I am of course biased, but it is still darn tasty!<br /><br />  Here it is folks, if you love almonds, if you love garlic, give it a try. I love them and highly recommend giving them a chance.

Roasted almonds are even better, but Emerald almonds are the worst tasting almonds I've have ever had. They barely taste like almonds and even have a strange coating on them.<br /><br />Any positive reviews have to be from an Emerald employee, family member or someone Emerald bribed to write something good.

review/summary: This gulasch is delisch!
review/text: I picked up one of these packets locally to try it for the first time.  Like most seasoning packets, it is going to carry a fairly significant amount of salt (10% of your RDA, according to the U.S. Nutrition Facts information), but that's about it as far as dangers from this packet are concerned.  The labeling (all in German) claims this packet makes 4 portions--but they're very generous portions; our family of 3 had more than enough to satisfy everyone, and enough left over for lunch the next day.<br /><br />Basic directions (again, in German) are printed on the back, to wit: cut a pound of meat (beef, pork or poultry) into cubes and brown in hot oil.  Add about 1 1/2 c. water, bring to a boil, add contents of the packet and return to boil.  Cover, turn to low and cook 60-90 minutes, or until meat is tender.  (Or cook in a 400 degree F oven.)  Serve with potatoes.<br /><br />Each packet also offers another recipe; ours had "Budapest-style" goulash on the back.  Here's how that one goes: cut about a pound of pork stew meat into cubes and brown them in oil.  Add a generous 1 1/2 c. water and the contents of the goulash spice packet.  Bring to a boil, cover, turn to low and cook for about an hour.<br /><br />In a separate pan, cook about 2 ounces bacon until crisp.  Drain off nearly all the fat, then add two chopped onions and two chopped bell peppers (red and/or green) to the pan.  Saute for 10 minutes, or until the onions start to take on some color.  Add these to the main pan along with 2 or 3 tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced (or use whole canned tomatoes, cut up), and cook another 10 minutes.<br /><br />We served this goulash over rice.  The original called for it to be served with potato dumplings, which would also be excellent.

This drink is not syrupy sweet like most sodas, and it has a complex and pleasing flavor.  I don't drink soda because I find it unsatisfying and lacking in flavor, but I would drink this regularly.

review/text: I received this as a free sample at work.  I left it sitting in my refrigerator for a few weeks before I got up the courage to try it.  As soon as you open the bottle, you could smell an almost <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JX5NGA">Dr. Pepper, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> scent.  I had an adventurous friend with me, so I poured the soda into two small glasses. It tastes strongly of anise (the main flavoring of black licorice).  I happen to love that flavor.  My friend said she could taste the burdock root, but not being familiar with that flavor, I could not.  My only complaint is that it is overly sweet.  I'm not much of a soda drinker, so this probably is a non-issue for those that do drink soda with any kind of regularity.  It basically tastes like a "virgin" Jagermeister cocktail.

The next batch was almost completely solid, and this latest batch is all milky liquid.<br /><br />I can use them no matter what the consistency, but it would be nice if Thai Kitchen had better quality control. I liked the solid batch because I could make a wicked alternative to chocolate mousse with it. You can't do that with the part-liquid or all-liquid consistency coconut milk. But mostly I use it in smoothies and in curries, so no big deal. I like to buy coconut milk in bulk so I'll continue to order this.

review/text: I've had a great many types of vegetarian meat alternatives from all over the world. Though these have soy  protein as well, they still have a bit of that rubbery texture/mouth feel that seitan "wheat meat" has. The price is for a very large can with quite a bit of product, so I thought that it was competitively priced with other similar products. I emptied the can and froze it for using what I need at a time, which has worked out well. It thaws perfectly. I don't think I will order again unless I need a shelf stable hydrated product. There are better tasting/textured options, including any of the Quorn chick'n tenders available with frozen foods.

review/summary: Silly people at Kellogg
review/text: Kellogg has a habit of putting objectionable ingredients into things it produces, especially when they have a kosher or vegetarian designation like Worthington and Loma Linda, both Kellogg products. In this case the packing broth has two interesting chemicals that I dare not name, so I emptied the broth down the drain and repeatedly filled the can with water to dilute the stuff. So, with luck, the concentration of broth ingredients has been reduced maybe tenfold. Ah yes, the "skallops" could be called Worthington "white meat", and they taste good with ketchup on pita bread from the Parthenon Amazon storefront.<br /><br />So, the question is whether Kellogg does these things as a cheaper alternative to having their own testing program for these chemicals. I mean, is it cheaper to sell this stuff as "food" to minority clients and deal with potential lawsuits than to run an FDA-approved testing program? Inquiring minds want to know.

It was still raining and cold here, so I chose not to expedite, but it arrived in perfect condition. Chocolate starts melting at 72 degrees, so keep that in mind when ordering. If it is hotter than that, either pay extra for the expedited delivery, or wait until it cools down to order.

So, on a $26 order, I would pay an additional $30+ for Expedited delivery.  When I initially received my melted chocolates, I contacted Euro Food Mart and received a very rude and curt reply from Cris in Customer Service informing me that during the checkout process I was offered shipping with ice gels, but I chose to decline it.  Sadly, the melted chocolates did not fair any better after being refrigerated.  They cracked easily and no filling was discernable.  Admittedly, it was my mistake not to notice the note on Expedited shipping, however, the response from Euro Food Mart's Customer Service lacked objectivity.  My rating reflects my entire experience....quality of shipped product and customer service experience.

review/summary: A nice step up from plain rice cereal
review/text: Our nine-month-old daughter is ready for a more substantial breakfast than plain cereals.  We want her to get the nutrients and vitamins she needs (especially iron), so plain fruit or vegetables aren't enough.  This blend of fruit and grains (and, in some cases, yogurt) provides everything she needs for a good breakfast and keeps her full for several hours.  Plus, the flavors are not overly sweet.  One note:  at least two of these flavors include yogurt.  Some babies younger than 1-year may have a reaction to yogurt and other dairy foods, so just watch out for that.

review/summary: A well-balanced meal for baby
review/text: We feed our baby this Wholesome Breakfast at any time of the day, not just for breakfast.  We're happy she's getting a good balance of vitamins and minerals.  Most jarred baby food is pretty light on the calories and nutrition, but the plain cereals that are fortified with essential vitamins/minerals are so boring and don't train a baby to enjoy different flavors.  We've been mixing cereal into our baby's food to enhance the nutrition, but that's inconvenient and messy.  This Wholesome Breakfast provides the best of both worlds:  the vitamins/minerals of a fortified cereal but with the stronger flavors of a real food.  We particularly like that this food contains yogurt.  When she was young (~6 months old), our baby loved yogurt but couldn't eat it plain because it would cause a rash around her mouth.  She was never bothered by the yogurt in this food, though, perhaps because it was mixed with other things.  Now that she's older (10 months), our baby can eat all the yogurt she wants without a skin reaction, but for awhile, this variety of Wholesome Breakfast was the only source of her favorite food.

review/text: This baby food, labeled for 6+ months, contains heavy cream. My baby could not digest it; we had a very bad day. Maybe I missed that in the description, but in any case, everywhere I've read and according to my pediatrician, you're supposed to avoid cow's milk products before age 1 (why they make formula using cow's milk and not a much more digestible milk like goat baffles me and is a rant for another time--my son drinks the lactose free kind, in any case). I ordered another variety of "Wholesome breakfast" too: Pear, Apple, Oatmeal. Same thing there. I'm guessing they all have heavy cream in them.

It has dates in it. Very few baby foods for breakfast have dates in them.. on the whole it's really a wholesome breakfast.. Add organic on top of that what else can you ask for..

August 2011..<br /><br />The idea is not about being able to return products, but to make sure the products are good in the first place.. think about the effort I have to put in now to return it... why does this happen? Is Amazon not reading reviews? Are people who pack the noodles not literate enough to read the expiry date? I am disappointed.

review/summary: An Ode to the Drink of the Gods...
review/text: This Mango Nectar is perfection! It deserves the highest praise, and I feel compelled to be the one to give it.<br /><br />First, it must be understood that this is a true delicacy and thus it is to be sipped and savored slowly, not gulped down indiscriminately like a can of coke. If you really want to get the most out of this true little slice of heaven, you have to address it unhurriedly , preferably with your eyes closed. It is best served refrigerated and I like to drink it straight out of the can, because even the can feels good, with its slim line and nice heft. It's actually quite a bit heavier than one expects... So, can or glass, take a sip and gently roll it around on your tongue, like you would a fine wine. Feel the thick richness of the nectar, dancing its dance of subtle, rich flavors in the hiddenmost recesses of your taste glands. Remember to breath gently through your mouth and nose too, to get the full effect of the subtle hues of this amazing fruit's aromas. Notice the tiniest little hint of bitterness - it really rounds out the "feel" of the mango. It no doubt comes from the pulp and, without it, this juice would not be nearly as delectable as it is.<br /><br />Does this sound like poetry to you? Perhaps it seems like it is a somewhat overdone description of a product that is, after all, "only a fruit juice", right? Well, I invite you to try it yourself and see if it is not deserving of every accolade I have ascribed to it and many others I may have missed.<br /><br />I am having one now and I must add, though it is probably fairly obvious, I feel it enhances my imagination and my creativity too... :)

I don't remember the Gran Riserva's characteristics that well - so it wasn't memorable, I guess. :-) Nothing much wrong with it, either. My expectations must have been high because it's called "Gran Riserva".<br /><br />If it was on sale, I would buy it. It's probably better than most other espresso beans; it is - after all - a Lavazza.

While these are not a health food, their sodium and fat content is much better than other snack foods. These chips work really well with a dip and vegetables for a pre-dinner snack.<br /><br />Shop for price. The price printed on the 10.5 oz bag that I buy at my local supermarket is $3.79 (and I pay less on sale), so the price on Amazon for 64 1.5-Ounce bags is more expensive. You are paying for the convenience of a single serving size.

review/summary: one of my favorites!
review/text: As far as salty snacks go, these are a veryclose second to the Meijer Organics cheese puffs. I like the 1.5 ounce bags, they are perfect for an on-the-go snack or in my lunch. The flavor is just like chips and salsa, perfectly seasoned and crunchy! One bag is 210 calories and a whopping 27 grams of whole grains, with 30% less fat than regular potato chips. Life is full of choices, this one is a no-brainer!

review/text: Sun chips are good, but now many other healthy snacks are out and they have not improved this product. This was a large quantity but the expiration was in just 60 days and the box came smashed ?? I Love amazon but some of the food buys you got to take your chances that this is not first quality stuff.

review/summary: Garden Salsa Rocks
review/text: I wasn't a real sun chips fan until I discovered the Garden Salsa  I would sometimes choose Sun Chips because with whole grain it was a healthier choice. After trying the Garden Salsa that is my preferred choice because they taste great. They are not too hot just have a nice little bite and a whole lot of flavor. I haven't bought them through Amazon but I have bought a lot of other products and I have not had any problems.

review/summary: Excellent flavor and texture, quite unique
review/text: I spotted this exquisite treat at a local gourmet food store and had to give them a try. Excellent flavor and texture, quite unique. And now I can't find them locally anymore, so glad to see them here.<br /><br />St. Dalfour raisins are not at all like the regular raisins, which are packed dry. These are moist! And tender and truly delightful. The sole ingredient listed on the label is: raisins. No preservatives.<br /><br />These raisins are vacuum packed in glass jars and remain moist and plump. I don't know how St. Dalfour achieves this, but the resulting product is simply delectable. I have also tried their raisin and cranberry mix, which is also excellent.<br /><br />A tasty treat right off the jar, but even better in desserts (ricotta torte, pear and raisin crumble, clafouti, bread pudding).<br /><br />Made in France.

review/summary: Like a kick to the nose (in the good way)!
review/text: I've been looking for a horseradish product that really attacks your naval cavity (the kind where you can barely keep your eyes open).  In recent years it seems I've either developed a bit of a tolerance or maybe most horseradish has been watered down.  I bought a bottle of Inglehoffer horseradish and it really packs the kick with a very little amount.  Very good.<br /><br />For a bit of honesty, my wife does not seem to think it's as strong as I do, so individual results may vary.  That's why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.

review/text: My advice is not to let the people who describe this horseradish sauce as mild fool you. I don't know what kind of cast-iron stomachs they have, but too much of this sauce at a time will take your breath away. I mix it with some sour cream to weaken the bite a little. It's good stuff, but it's not mild in the least.

I consider the product I received to be Jam not preserves, but definitions vary in different locations.

To salvage this purchase due to lack of time before Christmas, my husband will need to buy a new basket, some extra items, and repackage it himself.

I mean this is serious stuff.<br /><br />I bought one of these and gave it to her, explained that it was baby food consistency but wasn't baby food, and was fruit (didn't lie to her) but wasn't a cold smoothie like the kind Mommy makes (which she does NOT like).<br /><br />She slurped the whole thing down!  Tears came to my eyes I was so shocked and excited.  This whole feeding drama is very trying on my patience and I worry so often that she will have long-term problems.<br /><br />She has been devouring them ever since!  This as well as The Red One.  I cannot believe that she is "eating" fruit!!!  I am forever a loyal buyer of Ella's Kitchen products.  When my son is ready for solids, I will feed him Ella's baby food.  I cannot tell you how thankful and happy I am to finally get fruit in my daughter's belly!

review/text: My kids have tried all of the Ella's Kitchen "smoothies" and love them.  (By the way, they make baby food ones, too.)  This is a real blessing for any busy mom who has her hands full.  Or any on-the-go mom.  We brought these on a 4-day roadtrip and they were a lifesaver!  Everytime our kiddos got hungry, we'd hand them back one of these.  They could open and close them themselves, it was a very healthy snack, and it was not at all messy.  Ella's Kitchen pouches are notably easier than most squeezable fruits we've tried and we've pretty much tried them all--the tops are nice and big and easy for even toddlers to unscrew and screw back on. This one is a mix of currants, blueberries, bananas, and apples.  The other flavors are The Green One, The Yellow One, and the Red One. So yummy!

We travel quite a bit, and are very active with our children - so I've even used them as quick "sound bite snacks" when teaching, traveling, singing, or working. I recommend them for adults and toddlers alike!

review/summary: Great snack!
review/text: My little guy is 17 months, and we got a great deal on these so I stocked up without him trying any before. He LOVES them! They are great for on the go snacks, and he loves the independence that he gets from the pouches of this design (he can suck on the spout and suck the puree out himself). Good organic fruit, and good pricing on Amazon. Definitely a perfect option when homemade purees or fresh fruit is not a good option.

review/summary: One of the best baby foods for 6 month+
review/text: I love Ella's because there are so many great mixes of fruits and vegetables for my baby to try.  The best way to prevent a picky eater in the toddler years is to give a wide variety of flavors and textures when they're still babies.  I love all the pouches, because I don't want to get jars with BPA in the lining of the lid and I also don't have time to make baby food either.  Ella's says they hope to introduce recyclable packaging in the next year or two, but that right now, this is the best way to protect the foods that are made without preservatives.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a different flavor profile to introduce to their little one.  '

review/summary: Ella's Kitchen Organic - THE RED ONE
review/text: I have a 17 month old who absolutely loves these.  She has tried the Yellow One, the Red One and the Green One.  She likes them all.  We have tried other brands of convenient pounches and they are NOT the same, she will throw the other pouches on the floor.  When she sees Ella's at the store, she wants them right then.  As soon as I open it, she eats it up and asks for more.  She is small for her age, so I encourage her to eat these as much as she wants.  So glad I found these on Amazon, the price is so much better.  In the stores they average $1.50 - $1.79 each.

review/summary: Good, but other options  may be healthier
review/text: "The Red One", organic baby food "smoothie"<br /><br />If you're like me, you're interested in this item because it looks convenient and like something your baby will actually eat -- that would be a pretty good description of this product, with a few caveats:<br /><br />-The nutrition content of this product is not really that great.  We tend to mix this in with rice cereal for some iron, but otherwise it's a bit of a waste on its own.<br />-The taste is good, but maybe a little sweet for baby.<br />-The packaging is great -- very portable, screw top cap.  You tend not to waste much product with the packaging design.<br /><br />Just a reminder, the container is a bit smaller than some of the other "bagged" baby foods:  3 oz is less than the plastic Gerber containers (at 3.5 oz), but more than the small glass jar foods (usually 2.5 oz).

review/text: Picked one of these up this morning at our local natural foods market.  I gave it to my 22 month old daughter when we got into Kroger and she devoured it and asked for more, didn't have another so she sucked on the packaging the rest of the time in the store.  Will definitely buy more of these to have on hand for snacking on the road this summer, otherwise I will just buy the organic fruit and make it myself at home.  I tasted it too and it was delicious!  No GMO's and no pesticides, that sealed the deal for me.

review/summary: tasty, healthy snack
review/text: I prefer to stick with organic versions of the "dirty dozen" in produce (which, sadly, includes most berries), but I also try to follow my pediatrician's advice to have my son "eat the rainbow" each day. That gets tough, especially when we get into fall/winter, when fresh fruits and veggies are fewer and far between. Organic berries (like the strawberries and raspberries in this product) are expensive, hard to find, and definitely out of season right now here in NY. Enter Ella's Red One Smoothie Fruits. These pouches are great to have around as an option to round out my toddler's colorful fruit intake for the day. Not to mention, they're delicious - think applesauce, with sweet berries added for extra flavor and flair! And they're ideal when we're on the go. With a few of these tossed into my diaper bag, I always have something healthy and organic on hand for him to enjoy. They're even a nice snack for me when I find myself a bit low on energy when we're out and about. The crushed fruit inside these pouches is smooth (almost baby food consistency), so it slurps up through the straw-like top easily. Once I've unscrewed the cap, my 17 month old can eat this entirely without my help, leaving my hands free to get stuff done. Sweet!

review/summary: My current favorite food product
review/text: My little one eats very few purees nowadays.  He likes feeding himself.  However, these smoothies are good for both Baby and Momma.  a) The flavor is FANTASTIC with organic goodness bursting at the seams of your taste buds.  b)  I love, love, LOVE this pouch.  During a feeding, I normally start by squeezing a biteful at a time into a spoon for my little one.  No mess and resealable if he decides he only wants 1/3 of the container.  I've also found that after a while, my little one likes to hold the pouch and slowly squirt it into his mouth.  Once again, no mess for me to clean up, and Little Guy is very pleased at the food and being able to feed himself.<br />Fabulous product indeed.

review/summary: Delicious, Tasty and Healthy for my Little One!
review/text: My 20 month old loves fruits and vegetables! When I say he loves them, I mean he would pick them over his other snacks. So I don't complain when he asks for them either. We have a cupboard filled with these healthy snack pouches just on hand when we run out of his veggies and fruits. We take them along wherever we go. These come in very handy!<br /><br />We used another brand before this one (Plum Organics) but although tasty, they were more runny in consistency. I find that Ella's taste more natural as if they were truly mashed with a fork. Another reviewer thought that Ella's was more sugary but I don't agree. I think its because Ella's is more firmer than the Plum Organics, which tastes a little water down.<br /><br />My son loves these and doesn't even mind having some of the Stage 1 for babies! I gave this product 5 stars because it tastes good, its packaged nice, they come in different combinations and it healthy!

review/summary: Adult w/GERD
review/text: I am a twenty-six year old female. I'm short, and my metabolism isn't the worse, nor the best. I was looking for a healthier alternative to most snacks I find at the store, I was told this resembles applesauce and to try it. It's has a pleasant applesauce feel, and taste good to boot. Only qualm is, that it's a small snack and will not make you content if you're starved. Good to use in-between meals when not starved though!<br /><br />Update: August 4 2011 - I recently ended up with GERD and a really bad bleeding ulcer, due to stress and grief. I have problems keeping food down and went on a baby food diet for the sake of thriving. This stays down but is beginning to cause some indigestion at times. I'm not saying it would cause you guys to reflux or anything of that sort, but it was really acidic and caused me to choke. My throat now burns a lot, and feels sore, Please be weary if you're having gastrointestinal problems. Babyfood is such a great idea if you're having problems keeping things in, and need to retrain your stomach and intestines. Just be careful, some are more acidic than others.<br /><br />P.S. I like this flavor better than "The Red One".

I recommend sticking with the other flavors, especially carrot, parsnip, apple.  And frankly, I think Plum Organics makes better tasting blends that are delicious but not too sweet.

review/summary: I have GERD
review/text: I am a twenty-six year old female. I'm short, and my metabolism isn't the worse, nor the best. I was looking for a healthier alternative to most snacks I find at the store, I was told this resembles applesauce and to try it. It's has a pleasant applesauce feel, and taste good to boot. Only qualm is, that it's a small snack and will not make you content if you're starved. Good to use in-between meals when not starved though!<br /><br />Update: August 4 2011 - I recently ended up with GERD and a really bad bleeding ulcer, due to stress and grief.  I have problems keeping food down and went on a baby food diet for the sake of thriving.  This stays down but is beginning to cause some indigestion at times.  I'm not saying it would cause you guys to reflux or anything of that sort,  but it was really acidic and caused me to choke.  My throat now burns a lot,  and feels sore,  Please be weary if you're having gastrointestinal problems.  Babyfood is such a great idea if you're having problems keeping things in,  and need to retrain your stomach and intestines.  Just be careful,  some are more acidic than others.

review/summary: HUGE Package and a Good Value
review/text: I was taken aback when I opened the door and had a box from Amazon that measures 3'2" x 11.5" x 3.5"!! I had no idea how much kombu you get in 35 ounces (1 kg), until I saw this package. The actual package from Emerald Cove is 17" x 6.5" x 3" of 100% kombu. It will last for years if packaged correctly away from moisture.<br /><br />This package has 250 servings using a 1" x 4" piece. I am very happy because I pay almost $7 for a small 2.5 ounce package at my local natural foods store. I use kombu as a flavor additive in soups and stews, and for its rich sea mineral content of potassium, iodine and calcium -- unlike any other food. It does contain MSG naturally found in the sea, which enhances any food. Cooking with kombu doesn't add a fishy or seafood taste in the food - at all. It's surprising.<br /><br />The quality looks good for how I use it (which isn't for kelp salad). I'm very pleased with this purchase.

review/text: Convenient and tasty. Pop it in a bowl covered with plastic wrap, and microwave for 1 minute and 30 seconds. I tear up a mozzarella cheese stick and sprinkle it over the top before nuking. My boyfriend prefers his with a dash of Tabasco. I get a bit nostalgic eating these, since I used to frequently have them as an after-school snack when I was a child. Om nom nom, tasty!<br /><br />Tip: Use a napkin bib if you don't want a stained shirt. The sauce is a runnier than typical tomato sauce, and somehow, I always manage to get it on my clothes.

I'm not even a fan of dark chocolate, but surprisingly, I loved it!<br />I cut out the majority of added sugars from my diet about a year ago, so that means I cut out chocolate bars. I was pleasantly surprised that I could enjoy this chocolate without all the added sugar.

review/text: My husband and I love Emerald Cove sushi nori.  We eat it as a snack and digestion settler often (about 1 sheet a day each).  My husband steals out of my hand the first sheet I take, so I always have to go back for another.  He prefers its sweet toastiness greatly over the raw sushi nori.  Also, the price is excellent compared to the smaller pack prices or store-front shop prices.<br /><br />My only beef is that it comes from China, and I am concerned about the environmental quality during the growing process.  No guarantee there, though EC is a known brand.

review/summary: GREAT product at an affordable price!
review/text: Contrary to what the sugar industry would love us to believe, fructose is a MUCH healthier sweetener than sucrose (white table sugar, evaporated cane juice).  It is NOT the same as high fructose corn syrup (HFCS, by the way, has nearly the same molecular structure as sucrose at right around 50% glucose to 50% fructose ... so all of the health hazards announced with HFCS apply to sucrose as well ... this applies even the sneaky "evaporated cane juice", which tries to come off as a healthier sugar alternative). Glucose hits the bloodstream fast and hard, causing blood sugar to rise to very unhealthy levels, which then forces the body to release chemicals (insulin, adrenaline, etc) in order to try and bring blood sugar levels back to normal (this reaction is what causes "sugar highs and lows".  On the flip side, fructose sweeteners are processed by the organs and enter the blood stream slowly and steadily, as needed.  The ONLY time fructose carries health risks is when it's combined in the diet with the HEALTH-DESTRUCTIVE sweetener; sucrose! If you eliminate sucrose (common table sugar/evaporated cane juice) from your diet and replace it with a 100% fructose sweetener (fructose, agave nectar, fruit, fruit juice), you will get to enjoy MANY health benefits, some of which are: stable glucose levels, more balanced energy levels, lower cholesterol, cancer fighter (rather than being a cancer promoter like sucrose), etc.  I speak from the experience of many ... myself and my family included! My husband, prior to switching completely to fructose and staying completely away from sucrose, had type II diabetes, high cholesterol and his triglycerides were through the roof (over 900!!).  He was on medication for his diabetes, but didn't want to take Lipitor. Less than a year after we were married and he was completely away from sucrose, he was able to go off of his diabetes medication and his cholesterol and triglycerides were so low, his doctor stated "you just took one foot out of the grave and now have the cholesterol of a fit teen" Of course, common sense tells us that *all* sweets, even healthy sweets, need to be consumed in moderation ... too much of a good thing is still too much!<br />So don't buy into the fears that the sugar industry PAYS BIG BUCKS to breed ... buy into your health and enjoy this wonderful sweetener! It tastes like sugar and can be used just like sugar in recipes (you use about 25% less, so it's easier on the calories as well).

review/text: The description of this product is misleading - this fructose does NOT come from fruit but from a vegetable -CORN!  If you are following the Sugarbusters diet or diabetic in general - this will cause a sugar level issue - from the corn (starch converting to sugar) and the fructose together! Big problem!  There is nothing in online description to indicate this difference.  Found it on side panel of product when received.  The "100% granules" is misleading too - making it look like a natural product - it is not derived from 100% fruit sugar.  Do not buy if you are following a low-glycemic index diet.  Coordinating with Amazon to return.

review/summary: Very dangerous - research before you think about buying
review/text: I finally put pieces together -- why fructose had disappeared off any store shelves and I had to order it here, and also why they're having to advertise it on TV to try to turn back public perception.<br /><br />Fructose, and high-fructose corn syrup are proving to be very dangerous, causing many disruptive health problems. It's processed differently in the body than sucrose -- yes, our bodies CAN tell the difference -- and while they used to think that was good, they're now finding many ways in which it is bad.<br /><br />This is not returnable, so when I received my (2nd) order, I dumped it in the dumpster. It caused "non-alcoholic fatty liver disease", intense intestinal swelling and distress, highly-elevated blood pressure, and other problems that indicate these warnings were getting more serious.<br /><br />If this is from corn and not fruit, it's even more dangerous. (Thank you, reviewer "Debe".) Really check this out through Google, etc., before considering adding it into your life.

review/text: Was recommended this product by my acupuncturist to help with sleep and to keep the body 'regular.' Been taking Natural Calm Plus Calcium for 3 nights now. I am a small person, so only started with a half a teaspoon. I put it in Decaf Green Tea and take it before bed. It tastes fine, a little sweet. Now it's Day 3, and I don't know if this is one of those products that require 8 hours of sleep, but I feel foggy and exhausted, and have that 'sleeping pill' feeling, like I took a sleep aid but didn't sleep enough. (I sleep about 7 hours a night.) It's really not pleasant.<br />Am willing to try it some more, and will also be trying just the 'plain' Calm without the Calcium, Potassium, and Boron. Maybe those are messing with my head, not sure. Yesterday afternoon I was feeling funny, nauseous and also foggy in the head. I will say that I am sleeping more soundly at night, but to wake up feeling this groggy, and to have it last well into the morning is not fun. I will be testing more, but it seems to be doing funny things to me.

review/summary: Fibromyalgia
review/text: I had been enduring an agonizing week-long episode of what appears to be a fibromyalgic Tetany Syndrome of excruciating pain radiating from hip-joint to knee-joint along the muscles between the joints. In trying to describe to myself the electro-convulsive nature of it, I said it appeared to be like a fibrillation - only deep in my hip, and immediately the word "magnesium" popped into my mind. Dunno why.<br /><br />Tottered out to kitchen and One teaspoon of Natural Calm and 20 minutes later the convulsive constant spasms stopped. I was free from pain and able to sleep. Have had to keep a steady repeated dosage to keep the spasms at bay and it is difficult to admit that I probably have Fibromyalgia, but thank God for a remedy to the pain.<br /><br />I've kept the Natural Calm in my cupboard because of a peculiar muscle flutter/twitch I would get around the eyes when magnesium levels were low. Know this is just an anecdotal tale, but screaming pain one moment and no pain 20 minutes later, only difference being the magnesium is a tale that needs to be told.

review/text: I purchased Natural Vitality's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVY4PE">Natural Calm Raspberry-Lemon 16 oz</a> as a magnesium supplement to help me absorb calcium better because I was diagnosed with osteopenia--precursor to osteoporosis.  I will have to wait until my next bone density test in about a year and a half to find out if adding this readily absorbed magnesium product has helped my bones.  In the mean time, however, it has helped with my chronic constipation.  I had been using stool softeners for the past couple of years and this works much better.  It is a powder which you mix in a cup of hot water and stir.  I usually take 5 grams (a heaping teaspoon) once a day.  After it is dissolved, I add a little cold water so I can drink it quickly, although it does taste good.

Just don't take too much! Start out with a 1/2 tsp and you can gradually increase it, and you'll know when you've found the right amount for your body.

review/text: I don't usually leave product reviews, but this stuff is worthy of doing so.  I have taken magnesium supplements in various forms in hopes that they would help me get to sleep and stay asleep.  Natural Calm is the only supplement that has helped with my insomnia.  Every evening, I have a mug with a heaping teaspoon of Natural Calm in some water.  It really does help with my ability to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep all night.  I used to lie in bed and wait to fall asleep, sometimes for hours.  Now I can't even remember trying to get to sleep.  This product is wonderful!

review/summary: Good, but FAR TOO SWEET!!
review/text: I use this to calm my generally overactive system, deal with stress and sleep better, and it's not unpleasant. It's sweetened with Stevia, which I prefer to any other sweetener. One star off: it's horribly SWEET!! Most American-made sweet goods are sweet to such a degree that sometimes it's hard to detect any other taste, but even by those standards this stuff is incredibly oversweetened. I'll use it, but I wish there were another, less sweet and more natural flavor available. How about, say, mango or grape...?

review/text: I am disappointed to report that although this product did seem to have an effect on my anxiety the first time I took it, the second time I took it, it made me very nauseated. It may be the stevia; I am quite sensitive to artificial sweeteners (although I thought stevia was natural). At any rate, I am going to have to get rid of this product because I'd rather be anxious than vomiting. Call me crazy. If you are sensitive to non-sugar sweeteners, you may want to try a sample of this beforehand if you can find one before you shell out the money.

review/text: This stuff is truly amazing. Previously I had chemotherapy and the drugs took just about all the hormones away, hence giving me hot flashes. Calm helped to restore the balance and get me back on track, since I was kind of young for menopause. It has also taken my monthly cycle from 30-45 days right down to 28 days. It really is a great product. Magnesium is also wonderful for helping the body absorb calcium. I have been taking it for almost 8 months and I wouldn't think of stopping.

I actually look forward to having this in the AM with my breakfast and in the PM before bed. You can feel the relaxation slightly, it is not overwhelming. Not the kind of thing that knocks you out when you take it, but if you pay attention you can feel it.<br /><br />The great thing about the calcium is it is a great way to help sustain and maintain weight loss. This is the best flavor they offer no doubt about it.

review/text: orange seemed most appealing to me, but I do not like it. It works, but I have to build up to it. I just really don't like drinking it. It is really tart, slightly orange tasting, and I have a hard time getting it down. I have to chug it quickly. I'd rather take a pill and get it over with quickly. Just blech. I'd rather take Bluebonnet Calcium/Mag Vit D liquid, and that is a thick goopy liquid but I only need 2 TB of it. This is just hard drinking a whole glass. Aside from the texture/sense issue, the product works well, and I don't get restless legs at night. It does help me sleep and I am in a better mood since taking it.

It took about 2 - 2.5 weeks for the leg cramps to go away completely but I haven't had a leg cramp since (unless I don't take it every day).

review/summary: GREAT STOOL SOFTENER!
review/text: I do not get the calm relaxing better sleeping side effects from this. What I do get though is something that keeps my bowels regular. I take a medicine that causes heavy constipation, some users resort to taking laxatives every day which is addictive and dangerous. This is the best thing to clear you out and move things along. I've had two children and they send you home with a stool softener (Collace for me) and this works far better than collace. I started out about a week on just one large teaspoon. I was very bloated and backed up the entire time, it wasn't really doing much, then I upped to two large teaspons, without being graphic, it completely fixed my problem, although there were a few times if I hadn't been very close to a bathroom it could have resulted in a very traumatizing event. I don't think it tastes bad at all, I enjoy the warm drink in the evening, I put honey in mine, and use the natural one.

review/summary: LOVE this stuff!
review/text: Our chiropractor recommended Natural Calm for more muscle relaxation and deeper sleep - and my entire family takes it.  We've adjusted the dose for our 10 y/o downward (1/4 t. per day) and that's been better for him, but for my husband and me, the 1/2 t. dose is just right.  :)<br /><br />Our child has benefitted from it in that when he sleeps more deeply and doesn't wake easily, he has better days in lessons and is better able to focus.  That alone would make me re-purchase this product!  :)<br /><br />When we take it, we sleep better, more deeply, and if(when) we get up in the night to use the restroom, we don't struggle to fall back asleep - sleep is just *there*.  :)  I've also found that my "side stitches" - where the muscles at my ribcage contract and pull (it's uncomfortable) - go away when I take NC.  That's a beautiful side effect from taking it - and one I didn't expect.  My husband's infamous "Charley Horses" that wrack his legs with pain are virtually gone, too - and adding the NC has been the only change in his habits, so it's not like he's attributing the lack of cramps to anything else he's doing.<br /><br />I'm also a PCOS patient, which means I trend towards overproducing insulin.  With that, comes rough elbows and ridiculously dry skin - the NC has helped in that area as well.  My normal moisturizer doesn't touch my elbow-roughness, but the NC takes care of it on its own.  w00t!<br /><br />We like the lemon-raspberry flavour as well - it's like a hot lemonade in a mug.  :)<br /><br />All in all, we'll definitely be ordering more - I don't ever want to be without this supplement!

review/text: I can't write this review based off of continued use, as we just received it this week.  However, I wanted to say how glad I am that this product is available.  I have one child with asthma and another with autism.  Magnesium is suppose to benefit them both a lot, BUT getting children to take it is another story!  It's very sour and zingy, if that's a word, so the magnesium has taken a lot of coaxing to get them to take daily.  So I find this product of Peter Gillham's, and I'm so happy.  The kids say it tastes like warm sweet lemonade, and down it goes like a treat.  Also, very comforting to take just before going to bed.  Yeah!

It does have a "good" effect on your bowel movement, it's not a bad thing, it keeps you cleansed. I would highly recommend this for any with muscle, joint or bone pain.

review/text: Read the product claims.  Everything that is written is true.  As far as the taste goes---I add it to hot tea, then add ice to make it iced tea and it tastes as if I just added a little lemon in my tea.  Barely perceptible.  It is well worth the money.  All I can say is--give it a try.  It's not expensive and your health is worth all the money in the world.

review/summary: Natural flavor is NOT neutral
review/text: I bought the "natural" flavor, assuming it would be flavorless.  WRONG!  I bought it with the intention of adding it to my morning protein shake but it has a somewhat bitter citrus-y flavor that doesn't work in the shake.  I guess I need to try it just in water and see if I can tolerate it that way.  It's probably a great product/supplement but I'm having trouble getting past the taste.  Probably would have been better to get a flavored variety.

review/text: I have purchased this product due to its amazing reviews.  I have been having horrible health issues that started after taking a diet pill which has caused me drastic changes to my health.  I have been having issues with my digestive system, emotions, IBS, I never had heartburn now I do, I have cracked tongue, dry tongue, metallic taste in my mouth, I dont digest well my food.  I have done too many tests and nothing has been coming up but only GERD and have taken so many treatments for this but nothing helps me. :(<br /><br />I thought maybe this would help me but I dont see any change in anything.  Its been 5 days since I started.  I started with half teaspoon in morning and night, and then after a day did 1 tsp twice a day, then did 2 x a day but started to have diarrhea so now I am back to 1 twice a day.  I do not see it has made any changes, maybe it takes time, we will see.<br /><br />The delivery was fast taking into consideration I live in Doha, Qatar. and the package was in good condition.<br /><br />Will keep updating.

review/summary: THIS IS THE REAL DEAL! Ended years of IBS-C suffering
review/text: I tried every possible remedy I could find and nothing gave me consistent results. This product changed my life after 20 years of suffering from IBS-C. I only take one heaping tablespoon a day. I have been using it for about 2 years now and the results are very consistent. I ramped up my dose until I experienced loose stools and then backed off just a little until everything became normal. I am now thinking of breaking it into two smaller doses because the effervescent nature makes me burp like crazy for the first 15 minutes after taking it. But believe me, no matter what, it is worth it. I will most likely take this product for the rest of my life. THANK YOU to the makers.

review/text: I think the great majoority of us are magnesium defficient and I think this is a great way to up you magnesium intake. I do sleep better when I take it and tend to not wake up in the middle of the night.<br /><br />One caution would be to work up to your proper dose. Just don't go and start out with thee heaping teaspons! If you do you will need to keep the location of the nearest restroom in mind. Start at around a teaspoon and work up.<br /><br />This has a pleasant taste and I look forard to taking it in the evening. The container mentions mixing it in warm water and while I tried that I do not find that it is necessary. I just put two heaping teaspoons in a glass, add about six ounces of cool tap water and stir. After the fizzing goes away and it clears up drink it on down.<br /><br />I do recommend the larger sizes as it is more cost effective.

Finally opened it up, tried it before bedtime, went easy on the quantity due to reviewers suggestions.  Next morning, I did feel like I slept well enough, but the bowels were very active.  So be very easy on the tiny spoonful of it is all I can say.  It takes a lot for me to have loose bowels.  This is like a natural laxative.  I don't use it every night though.  Don't want to worry I need to stay home to be near the toilet.

It has coincided with me taking this supplement.  But I have heard that excessive thirst is also symptom of diabetes.  Is it documented anywhere that magnesium can result in thirst?  If anyone can share this info, it would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />As for the product, I just started it.  The taste is citrusy.  I have had no side effects other than thirst.  But I don't know how much is psychological I have already been feeling more energy.  I will update if I continue this for a longer time hopefully.

review/text: For the most part, I'll just echo what previous reviewers have said. This stuff is wonderful for putting you to sleep fast, as well as helping with anything to do with muscle relaxation. I've found it helps with both the cramps and mood swings of PMS, and even seems to lessen eye strain headaches. It's also proving invaluable as a way to counteract the rebound insomnia and moodiness of withdrawal from a prescription sleep medication. I take away one star (and would make that a half if I could), because in its raw form (or merely blended with water), it tastes terrible. But mixed with a sweet juice, it's decently palatable.

review/text: This is an excellent source of magnesium which provides a number of health benefits.  Some obvious and some not so obvious.  I have trouble sleeping, waking up many times at night and like everybody else I deal with my fair share of stress.<br /><br />I take a 1/2 teaspoon at night about an hour before bed time along with 5-htp and phenibut powder, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007YY2XQE">5-HTP Powder 10 Grams + FREE Primaforce Phenibut Powder 100 Grams</a>.  I started taking the magnesium long before the 5-htp or anything else, taking them together definitely enhances the mood and sleep stabilizing effects, if that's what your looking for.<br /><br />The Raspberry Lemon flavor doesn't taste delicious but it certainly does not taste bad so it is not a chore what-so-ever to drink a glass each night before going to bed.  Since I've started this nightly ritual nights have become more peaceful, days have become brighter (i.e. tears from stressful situations do not rear their ugly head nearly as much).  I've been happier, plain and simple.

Also increased my ability to deal with difficult "crisis" situations.<br />Mood--- Made me generally happier.<br />Decreased muscle cramping and soreness.<br />Improved gums and teeth.<br />Improved hair loss.<br />Improved digestion and transit time.<br /><br />Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right??  Me too!<br /><br />But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without.  It has made that important an improvement in my life.  It is almost like a miracle.  Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume.  Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume.  In America this ratio is about 4 to 1.  Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1.  I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day.  (Try "The Magnesium Factor" by Margaret Seelig or "The Magnesium Miracle" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two.  You probably won't need that long.  I noticed an improvement in two days.  A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results.  Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want.<br /><br />Here's wishing you great health!

review/summary: Review on TASTE
review/text: I'm writing this review, because it's exactly the kind of review I was looking for before I bought this product, but could not find anywhere.<br /><br />When I first started using Natural Calm I bought it in the Raspberry-Lemon flavor, thinking it sounded the best and used it with water (usually just put it inside a water bottle and shook it up to mix it and drank it that way). Both me and my husband used it and HE really liked the taste, but for me this stuff tasted BAD. I don't know why, but I did not like the taste at all. I guess some people do (obviously my husband did or at least didn't mind it) but I definitely did not. It made drinking it everyday a CHORE.<br /><br />So, this next time I decided to try the one that isn't flavored and I like it SO MUCH better, like a million times better. I just mix it in with my blueberry-pomegranate juice and it's great! It is virtually tasteless and just adds a little 'fizz' to the juice that I actually LIKE. I also put it in teas as well.<br /><br />I wanted to write this review just to let people know that not everyone loves the raspberry-leomon flavor (and I didn't think I'd like the orange to begin with, but haven't tried it yet and probably never will). There are a lot of reviews claiming it tastes great... but for me not so much. I recommend the flavor-less one.<br /><br />Also, be careful when starting out to use the recommendation on the bottle and start with 1/2 a teaspoon a day and then work up from there. :-) I never had any negative side effects, but I guess some people get diarrhia if they take too much in the beginning.<br /><br />This stuff really is amazing and will help you feel GREAT! :-) If you're thinking about trying it don't hesitate. It has many, many benefits. You might just be using it to help with mood or to help with ADHD/concentration, or just for a natural way to keep from becoming constipated... There are MANY benefits. But no matter what you're using it for, it's bound to help out your body and mood in other ways as well! :-) Can't say enough good things about this product! Just try to get the flavor-less one first, it's so much better!! I hated having to drink it when we had the raspberry-lemon one. But now I definitely don't, and like the little fizz it gives my blueberry-pomegranate juice & teas! :-) Drinking it right now and loving it! And loving the way it makes me feel and the concentration it gives me!

review/summary: OMG It WORKS!
review/text: I have been using this product for almost a week now and my only complaint is that I didn't find pit about it sooner! First, a bit about myself. I am a 45 year old black woman, suffering from gout, constipation, fibrmyalgia, muscle cramps, brain fog and horrible insomnia, along with chronic depression and yes I am overweight, yes folks I am a hot mess!<br /><br />I found out about CALM from an article about the five vitamins and supplements that our bodies need the most, I was already taking four of them, so that made me feel good and when I read about CALM, I was like great this may be just what I need, especially after I read about all of the possible benefits that were to be achieved after taking CALM.<br /><br />Well, let me tell you how it has helped me in under a week. I am sleeping through the night, my mood is improving and that in of it self is a miracle. I have been suffering from depression for over 20 years and nothing helped, this is helping. I am able to think a bit clearer and turn off my brain, which in turn is also helping me sleep!<br /><br />Another major benefit is relief of muscle pain and cramps, especially after exercising! I did a particularly tough workout the other day, well hell any workout when you're fat can be tough, but this one consisted of weight training, cardio and ab work. I fully expected that I would be in horrible pain the next morning, but I wasn't as a matter of fact, I felt great! This also, seems to be helping with my fibromyalgia too.<br /><br />Now, the biggest benefit so far is the relief from my contipation! If I went once a week, I considered myself lucky. I had tried everything under the sun to get things moving so to speak, and either it would work for a while and then nothing, or worse yet nothing would happen at all. Any one that has suffered from constipation, knows now horrible it can be and how miserable you can become, both emotionally and physically. Well, since I have been taking CALM, I go two sometimes three times a day! I feel so much lighter, my friends and family always said I was full of crap and I guess they were right!<br /><br />I guess after reading my review you are thinking either she is being paid for this or it really works, well it is definitely the latter! It is working for me and I believe it will work for you too, try it what have you got to lose besides a crappy mood, sleepless night, a lot of crap and cramps? Jeez, I think $23.00 is a pretty fair trade off don't you.<br /><br />One more thing the dosage that I am using is two teaspoons at night and one teaspoon in the morning, both with 3 teaspoons of benefiber mixed in  girl still needs her fiber! and BTW it's a store brand). I hope this review helps and if you have any questions please contact me, I am real and this review is real!

review/summary: A major improvement in menopausal symptoms
review/text: I tried this product after researching menopausal heart palpitations and internal tremors on www.power-surge.com.  The relief was immediate!  What surprised me was the improvement in many other aspects of my health.<br />No more headaches that feel like a tight cap binding my scalp.  Reduction of my migraines. No more nightmares (brought on by hormone fluctuations).  No more "internal earthquakes" or buggy-crawling sensations on my skin.  Less anxiety (formerly triggered by hormonal changes). No more weak nails.  Monthly acid reflux greatly reduced, sometimes none at all. Greatly reduced frequency of colds, flus and sinusitus.<br />I chose the Calm with Calcium since I am dairy allergic.  My body assimilates it well, much better than calcium & magnesium pills, which had little to no effect on the above-mentioned problems (in ANY ratio).<br />Overall, I feel much calmer & more energetic.  Not a cure-all, but definitely has raised the quality of my life.<br />I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: " A MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!"
review/text: I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician. I'm wound REALLY tight. I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try "Natural Calm"; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot.<br /><br />I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because "Natural Calm" does the job.<br /><br />I've been taking "Natural Calm" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff.<br /><br />As for negatives to "Natural Calm"...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick.<br /><br />All in all 5+ stars. "Natural Calm" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer.

review/summary: Great for multiple things
review/text: I originally started taking Calm for the magnesium to help with my Chronic Idiopathic Constipation. I put a couple of teaspoons in hot water and drink a mugful before bed every night and I have been very regular ever since. The taste is almost too sweet but that's probably a perk for some people. It tastes like hot lemonade, nothing chalky about it which is nice. It can be drunk cold but I find that 1) it works better when used with hot water and 2) it tastes better in hot water (cold water doesn't dissolve it well enough and you end up swallowing chunks of the magnesium). Within the first day or two of taking the Calm I realized that not only was I regular but I was sleeping much better. After one mugful, I fall asleep within the hour and also the cramping I was getting in my legs at night has diminished. I started taking this for one reason but realized there are a lot of benefits to it. I will warn you, on the directions it says "add 1oz of water, watch it fizz...", and it FIZZES. I made the mistake of filling my cup with water first and then added the Calm and made an enormous mess! It fizzes up at the slightest splash of water and also when you stir so just do it little by little and you'll be fine :)

review/summary: Natural Calm Magnesium
review/text: I have used this product before in the calcium/magnesium blend. It was suppose to be tasteless.  It wasn't.  It tastes awful.  This lemon-raspberry tastes okay and the product is more reactive when the hot water is added.<br /><br />I was medically advised to take my magnesium in this form because of slipped disks in my back.  This is only one piece of my back program however I can attest to the efficacy of the product.  My disks are no longer slipped.  It has helped me to heal.<br /><br />A bonus benefit for me is that taking the magnesium in this form has stopped the migraines that I have had for 36 years of my life.  I have learned that if a headache begins that I need a dose of Natural Calm.  I was dealing with a magnesium deficiency.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product to anyone with muscle or joint issues, migraines,and back issues.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVY4PE">Natural Calm Raspberry Lemon Flavor 16oz, Natural Vitality</a>

review/summary: one of the most important minerals for asthmatics
review/text: I've been taking this for over a year before going to bed and have not had any problems going to sleep or staying asleep at night since I've started taking it.  According to the experts, it's one of the most important minerals for asthmatics to take because it relaxes the bronchial tube muscles hence either eliminating or reducing bronchial tightness/restriction.  Although my asthma has been asymptomatic for quite some time, the magnesium is good to use for so many other reasons and to maintain my health.  It's also a natural laxitive and helps prevent indigestion.  This is 100% natural elemental magnesium citrate so there is no need to worry about taking in any strange chemicals as you would when taking a synthetic vitamin supplement.

review/summary: Wouldn't Go Without It
review/text: I've had frequent headaches, muscle cramps, and headaches since I was a child.  I have vivid memories of laying awake into the late hours of the night before exhaustion and sleep would settle in.  When I reached high school, the stress transformed the frequent headaches into occasional migraines.  I treated them for a while with prescription medicine but eventually decided I'd rather live with the pains and adjust in the necessary ways than continue taking medication.  About a year ago, I read an article about Natural CALM and figured `What the heck.'  I was highly doubtful.  I've never been so glad to be wrong.<br /><br />I buy the raspberry-lemon flavor.  To me, it tastes like a bit of raspberry lemonade Crystal Light mixed with an Alka-Seltzer.  I certainly wouldn't drink it just because I'm thirsty, but I can tolerate a 12 oz. glass of it in the evening.  In the beginning, I didn't feel much of a difference.  However, once I started taking about 1 teaspoon - which you have to work up to - I noticed a difference in my quality of sleep.  I kept slowly raising the amount and now use about 2 teaspoons nightly.  I don't find that the CALM makes me fall asleep earlier/faster, but I have found that I don't constantly wake up like I did before.  The nighttime leg cramps have almost completely gone.  And the headaches - the constant pounding and throbbing and aching in my head has diminished to just the occasional headache.  As an added benefit, I seem to deal with stress (especially work stress) much better than I did before.  I tried something else to help with sleep (see below) and, after I stopped taking that, I didn't start taking the CALM again for a little while to see if I could actually tell a difference in the way I felt, slept, and reacted to events.  I did - and so did some others around me!  From now on, I don't plan to go without it.<br /><br />I love this stuff and I turn as many people onto it as I can.  A friend purchased some CALM (the regular flavor:  it worked but tasted pretty bad and made the nightly dose challenging to keep up with) and decided to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N23AE8">SERIPHOS - 100 - Capsule</a> when she ran out of CALM.  While I was visiting, she gave me some to try.  We both found that it gave us the oddest nightmares and made us very groggy/tired in the morning.  My mother, at her doctor's recommendation, started taking a small dose of melatonin to help her get to sleep and stay asleep through the entire night (she'd often get up about 3 AM and couldn't get back to sleep).  Several times after she started taking it, I called her and she slurred her words as if she were taking some sort of narcotic and she wouldn't remember that she'd even spoken to me on the phone.  I sent her a bottle of the orange flavor (she said it tastes ok - like a Sunny D Alka-Seltzer) and she actually adds it to her morning and bedtime cups of decaf orange tea instead of using the melatonin.  She's sleeping like a champ now.<br /><br />If you're considering the purchase, do it!  Like everything, it may not work for everyone, but it's worth a try if you're even thinking about it.

review/summary: Headaches
review/text: I am getting serious headaches from using this product. I know it is supposed to help with migraines but it seems to be having the opposite affect on me. I took 2 teaspoons yesterday and i got a raging headache. Is this too much for the first time? i've been using Mag supplements for years and thought my body would be used to it. Any suggestions or recommendations i would surely love to hear them<br /><br />I still gave this product 4 stars because i think it is great and has huge potential. Like i said i've taken several high quality mag supplements for years and none of them stopped leg cramps and muscle spasms, eye twitches so quickly.It did give me better sleep but not the best but i'm sure that comes with time. The pills i was taking were big horse pills and i didn't take them alot because of the size. I am taking this because of my Vitamin D deficiency that i just can't seem shake, although it's only been 7 months. You have to have Magnesium for Vitamin D to absorb properly. This does loosen your stools some, but i've never had a problem in that area, thank goodness.<br /><br />I am open to suggestions about the dosage. I will wait a few days and maybe start with 1/2 teaspoon ans see how that goes.

The actual bottle you get is only 8 oz.<br /><br />I was very disappointed when the product arrived and saw the tiny little bottle. Won't purchase this item again.

review/summary: YUCK
review/text: I bought this product, based on many positive reviews, and was not satisfied. I got the original flavor, which I followed the directions while preparing it. First of all, it is vile. My husband tried it also and agreed it is like the taste of acid, and burns the throat just as bad. I purchased this in hopes of getting some relief from my anxiety and also to relieve my IBS. To put it nicely I'm lucky to "poo" twice a week, but when I'm stressed it is non stop. So every week is different. This product boasts its ability to regulate you, as well as to relieve stress and anxiety. I have not found this to be true so far. The taste is hard enough to get over, but it is not the worst part. After drinking it my stomach fills with air to the point that it is painful. I still can't "poo" but my husband will not be pleased tonight while I fart all over him in my sleep. It sounds funny, but it sucks. I gave it two stars only because I seem to be the exception rather than the rule. I am disappointed.

review/text: I bought this product once before and took for about a week. I did not notice it helping with sleep. I continued to wake every night. I also don't notice that it calms me down. I just had a screaming match after taking 1 teaspoon in hot water and hour before. Maybe it takes a longer time to notice? I didn't notice anything the last time either but I will continue to take it as I need magnesium.

review/summary: Chemical supplements should be taken based on the advice of a qualified health care provider
review/text: As I have problems with sleep at night and tried all sorts of things which are most commonly recommended to improve it, I tought I try this well rated product. I tried it in all the various recommended dosages. But it didn't make the slightest difference for me. Thus I guess that it probably only works if the cause of the unrest is a magnesium deficiency.<br />Reportedly:<br />"With supplements, overdose is possible, however, particularly in people with poor renal function; occasionally, with use of high cathartic doses of magnesium salts, severe hypermagnesemia has been reported to occur even without renal dysfunction".<br />"Safety Issues<br />The US government has set the following upper limits for use of magnesium supplements:<br />Children<br />1-3 years: 65 mg<br />4-8 years: 110 mg<br />Adults: 350 mg<br />Pregnant or Nursing Women: 350 mg"<br />"It has been called nature's calcium channel blocker."<br />"Magnesium assists in calcium uptake, but it also competes with dietary calcium for the same absorption site in the intestine. Excessive dietary calcium (or phosphorus) is much more likely to block magnesium absorption than vice- versa in the typical American diet. Magnesium absorption is also inhibited by excessive dietary fat, phosphate, lactose, phytates and oxalates which form insoluble compounds with magnesium. Magnesium is also lost in diarrhea, long term use of diuretics, excessive sugar intake and protein malnutrition...<br />...  there are lower levels of minerals in food today due to depletion of the soil in modern farming methods. (23) Modern methods of milling, processing and the preservation of food cause nutrient losses, eg 85% of magnesium is removed from whole wheat in the milling."<br />Thus it is advisable to consult a qualified health care provider if a deficiency is suspected.<br />It's usually best to avoid deficiencies by a healthy diet: "Kelp is very high in magnesium, as are whole grains, almonds, and cashews..."

review/summary: The Best Supplement EVER!!!
review/text: When I read one of the reviews that stated that this supplement changed their life, I was immediately excited because this supplement has changed my life as well!  I started taking this supplement as a part of my diet plan (Ideal Protein).  I took it to help me with bowel movements.  Lucky for me, not only did it improve my bowel movements, it fixed my insomnia problem.  I had insomnia and could not fall into deep sleep for years.  Within 2 weeks of taking this supplement, I was sleeping like a new born baby!  In addition, I became more relaxed and my anxiety completely disappeared!!  It did not stop there...my menstrual cycle is regular now and I no longer have muscle twitches.  TOTALLY CHANGED MY LIFE!<br /><br />I was soo excited about the improvement in the quality of my life, so I quickly spread the news to all my family and friends.  I worked like wonders for all of my family members.  The results from my friends was a mixed bag.  I think that for the people that have a true magnesium deficiency, this is a miracle supplement.  For those that may not have a true magnesium deficiency, this may not be the magic bullet for them.  I hope that this review was helpful.  I was compelled to spread the word about this supplement because it has truly changed my life!!!

review/summary: Weird and Amazing!
review/text: I purchased this product because my muscles were very tight. It does a great job relaxing my muscles. The strange thing is, I can't take very much or I have the wildest dreams imaginable. It also makes me tired if I take even so much as a level teaspoon each day.<br /><br />I started taking much less so that I wouldn't have those hyper-realistic dreams. I take 1/8 teaspoon twice a day. Here's the amazing thing. I get these spells of "skipped" heartbeats -- PVCs and PACs. A mere 1/8 teaspoon of this stuff nips it in the bud in minutes! I quit taking the betablockers I have on standby for this problem because this product is so effective.<br /><br />This morning, my husband accidentally made me 16 oz. of caffeinated coffee. Since I have significant issues with anxiety, I *never* drink caffeine. I gulped it down and started feeling incredibly jittery and anxious. When I realized what had happened (and that I wasn't merely going crazy), I took 1/8 teaspoon of Natural Calm. While I still felt hyper-alert, the jitteriness went away entirely.<br /><br />LOVE this stuff, and am so thankful that it is available!

review/summary: This one supplement has changed my life!!!!!
review/text: I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.)<br /><br />None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life.<br /><br />That is, until Natural Calm.<br /><br />This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically!<br /><br />Here are the things this supplement has helped with:<br /><br />Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night.<br />Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult "crisis" situations.<br />Mood--- Made me generally happier.<br />Decreased muscle cramping and soreness.<br />Improved gums and teeth.<br />Improved hair loss.<br />Improved digestion and transit time.<br /><br />Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too!<br /><br />But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try "The Magnesium Factor" by Margaret Seelig or "The Magnesium Miracle" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results. Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want.<br /><br />Here's wishing you great health!

review/summary: Excellent to relieve muscle, joint pain, sleeplessness
review/text: My 80 year old Mom suffered from excruciating back and muscle pain. When I took her to see an MD specializing in pain relief, he recommended she try using CALM first, stating many of his patients found significant pain relief by addressing their magnesium deficiency by taking CALM. After she successfully reduced the pain using CALM as part of the regimen prescribed by her MD, my husband and I started using CALM for our muscle and joint pains, (61 and 58) and also found relief from pain; we accidently discovered it promotes a good night's sleep when we missed taking it one night and did not sleep as well. All of us now use CALM daily and stockpile a 3 month supply!

I know, too much information but seriously....I generally crack and I held it together this time. I give some of the credit to this stuff.

review/summary: Great Product In Wrong Container
review/text: Undoubtedly, the purchase and use of stool softeners would plummet if everyone, including physicians, considered magnesium.<br /><br />Fact: An insufficient amount of magnesium in the body is a primary cause of constipation and hemorrhoids, yet most physicians unwittingly recommend stool softeners.<br /><br />Fact: By taking your measure of Natural CALM daily your constipation will quickly subside.<br /><br />Friends, before you devour any more medications why not try a natural remedy?<br /><br />Natural CALM is an easy-to-assimilate powder that when mixed with water becomes effervescent. More effective and absorptive than tablet form, Natural CALM is the best selling ionic magnesium supplement to be found in health food stores to date. Choose natural or one of four flavored varieties. It's all the same healthful Natural CALM.<br /><br />Magnesium is also attributed to curing or moderating all of the following conditions: leg cramps, headaches, hair loss, insomnia, high blood pressure, nervousness, muscular disorders and depression. That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars.<br /><br />Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary. Soon you discover your proper dosage.<br /><br />Directions are unclear as to the amount of water to be used: "Place powder in a glass or mug," it says. "Add 2-3 oz of hot water. Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water."<br /><br />Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide.<br /><br />Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy.<br /><br />Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch.<br /><br />Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors? No fructose added. For further information call customer service at (866) 416-9216.<br /><br />Take charge of your health. Live life to the fullest.

review/summary: aptly named product
review/text: Have been using Natural Calm for 6 years. Highly absorbable form of magnesium helps with nutritional balance and is a quick-acting, gentle muscle relaxer/tension tamer. If you take calcium supplements or eat a lot of dairy, you might consider supplementing with magnesium. Calcium is used in contracting muscles; magnesium is used in relaxing them. If you have a lot of calcium in your system and not enough magnesium, those muscles can't completely relax! My old massage therapist gave this to every client before his/her massage; she said she didn't have to work as hard to relax stubborn, tense muscles after folks had taken this. Hubby takes it on business trips to keep all systems balanced and avoid tension headaches from Atlanta airport! This is hands-down the best price I've seen for the product, and it was delivered to my door. Can't beat that.

review/summary: Very Good Source of Magnesium
review/text: If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium.  This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium.  My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night).  A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this.  As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate).  After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared.  One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too.<br /><br />I have only two problems with the product.  First, this particular flavor of Natural Calm neither tastes nor smells all that great:  it's sickly sweet.  However, there is a non-flavored variety which is great (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OQ2DL4">Natural Vitality - Natural Calm, oz, 16 powder</a>).  Also, it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage.  I've subtracted one star from my rating for those.  But, still, I rate this at a Very Good four stars out of five.

review/text: I've been using this product for about 2 years to treat skipped heart beats which I have suffered with for about 4 decades with zero help from the medical community. It has been one of the only supplements I've tried in that same period that has lived up to it's promises. I also have had problems with constipation for most of my life ( I'm sure it's because of my terrible diet which includes lots of sugar) and it also totally solved that problem. I would like you to know that I own no stock in the company, I do not know anyone in the company,I do not sell this product, and I do not have a dog in the fight however I would hate to think that I could no longer be able to get this product. After using several different types of magnesium I proclaim this to be the very best with no one in close 2nd place. I will tell you it takes a small amount of effort to figure out how much your body needs, I usually take about a teaspoonfull a day mixed in a bottle of plain water and I drink it though out the day and I do this about 3 times a day. This product has litterally changed my life and I think I could write a small book about it. I've told numerous people about it and it's a shame there are so many scams in the world that we as a people are so sceptical and that when a great product comes along we sometimes ignore it..

review/text: I have a lot of trouble getting to sleep at night, and I have suffered from migraines for most of my life. This product seemed like the perfect solution to both problems.<br /><br />For the sleep issue, I have never found anything that even comes close. I actually fell asleep, shortly after going to bed, with ease. This was really an incredible change for the better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I discovered that my migraines got worse when I was taking this. Not just a little bit worse, MUCH worse. It was as if the worst part of the migraine got extended much longer than normal. It was to the point that I had to be driven home from work and ended up in the ER in one case while I was taking this (the normal dose recommended on the label). This was the first and only time I have ever been to the ER for a migraine in 20+ years of getting migraines.<br /><br />Even after that incident I really wanted to continue at least with a small dose before bed. I tried this on and off for several weeks, but unfortunately it consistently aggravated my headaches the next day anytime I took it.<br /><br />I've noticed other forms of Magnesium also cause headache issues for me, which is odd since it is supposed to help prevent them. So, hopefully this reaction is fairly individual to me. But the lack of much of any negative reviews for this product compelled me to write a review. Evidently, not everybody reacts well to it (but I do really, really wish I could take it for the sleep benefit.)

review/summary: Absolutely amazing -- thank God for this product!
review/text: A little over a week ago and completely out of the blue, I started having heart palpitations.  I'm a 27-year-old female and am on no medications and have no significant medical history.  The first two days, I only noticed a few of them.  Then for the next 3 days, I had them much more frequently.  I could put my fingers on my pulse and literally feel my heart skipping beats (a long pause followed by 2 closer-together beats).  It was absolutely terrifying; I couldn't sleep for two nights because I was afraid I wouldn't wake up.  I had read that these are typically harmless, especially if they aren't accompanied by any underlying heart issues or symptoms.  But that doesn't make them any less frightening and unsettling.  Finally, on day 5, I went to the doctor who confirmed with an EKG that I was having premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).  He told me just to forget about them, that they were harmless.  That lessened my anxiety related to the heart palpitations a bit, but I knew something had to have caused them, and I wasn't content to just deal with them forever.  I had my blood checked, and I was neither hyperthyroid nor hypothyroid, and my potassium level was normal (these are potential causes of the PVCs according to my doctor, in addition to caffeine and stress).<br /><br />But I also read that a magnesium deficiency can cause heart palpitations (and being deficient wouldn't have been a surprise because my diet had been less-than-ideal).  So, on day 6, I went to a health food store and was encouraged to try this product.  I paid $18 for 4 ounces!  I went home and took a big initial dose (probably 2 teaspoons) and, within a few hours, I noticed that my heart beat wasn't skipping as frequently.  The next day, I noticed an occasional flutter but nothing like the big scary pounding flip-flops from the days before.  The next day, they were gone altogether, and they have not returned.  I have been palpitation-free for several days now, and I undoubtedly owe my relief to this magnificent magnesium!<br /><br />Beyond the cessation of the abnormal heart beat, this product helps me sleep like a log!  It has also made me feel much calmer, even in situations where I ordinarily would feel anxious.  I am truly thankful to have found this product!

My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too.<br /><br />I've also tried a flavored version of this product (Natural Vitality - Natural Calm Rasp-Lemon, oz powder, 16 powder).  Unlike that version, this stuff is entirely odorless, and the only taste is a sense of tartness.  I much prefer this non-flavored version over the flavored version.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this product is that it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage.  That's pretty insignificant.  So, I still rate it at an Excellent five stars out of five.  Highly recommended.  Especially if you're taking calcium.

review/text: I LOVE this product.  I would do without food before I would do without this.  The benefits are multiple - it helps keep you regular and also helps take the stress and tension out of your muscles.  It does take 4-6 weeks to notice full change in your muscles.  I certainly don't feel the stress in my upper back the way I use to - and I still do the same type of computer work day in and day out.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.  You won't regret it - and Amazon has the best price of anywhere I've found it so far.

review/summary: Great help to stop constipation
review/text: I have been suffering from chronic constipation my whole life. Four to nine days of misery was my regular life. Nothing helped me for more than two times. A colleague of mine recommended me this product and since I tried it I'm very regular! It is not like the other products I tried (and I really tried a lot of them)that helped me just a couple of times and afterwards no effect anymore. In addition the frequent muscle cramps I use to have have disappeared. In summary I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product, I'm not going to stop taking it anymore!

review/summary: Miracle Supplement
review/text: Magnesium is vitally important on many levels.  It not only helps your muscles to relax, but also aids sleep and allows for a more calm & balanced state of mind. Low levels of this mineral make nearly every disease worse, whether you are dealing with asthma, diabetes, depression or cardiovascular disease. It  assists in the assimulation of calcium & potassium, so those with osteoporosis concerns should be looking to include Magnesium in their supplements.<br /><br />I have been using Magnesium Calm for the past year and have found it very helpful for relaxing muscle tension, & getting a good nights sleep, not to mention its calming effect on my state of mind ! Its easy to take and comes in several flavors as well. I recommend it to many of my massage clients, so they can decrease the pain and discomfort in their bodies.

review/summary: Helps with Heart Palpitations
review/text: After a little bit of research, I learned that magnesium plays a crucial role in the regulation of the heart. After being on medication for some time for unpleasant heart palpitations (which never worked too well), I decided to give this supplement a try. In about 2 months, the palpitations were completely gone, and I don't have to take that horrible drug anymore! This stuff is awesome. This was about a year ago. I have come to realize that doctors know nothing about caring for the human body and know very little about real nutrition. Your just a customer to them; they make their money by prescribing dangerous drugs that only mask symptoms but don't correct the problem at its source. Magnesium is so important for the body - you cannot go wrong with this supplement. Most people are deficient in this important mineral because the land is so devoid of important minerals these days, so it's very hard to get from food alone. This is the best magnesium supplement on the market. Don't take those cheap magnesium pills you can get at any store. Most of them don't get absorbed by the body and act only as a laxative. Magnesium citrate, of which this product is, gets assimilated easily. Don't be surprised if other problems your having begin to clear up as well. Magnesium deficiency can cause a lot of problems. Read the book "The Magnesium Miracle" for more info.<br /><br />Peace.

review/text: For most of my life I have had a hard time getting to sleep at night. It takes me hours some nights. I sit up and think about crap at work, people I went to school with as a child and all other kinds of random stuff. But I can honestly say this stuff does the trick. I've bought countless supplements over the years and none of it has really worked on helping me get to sleep but this stuff is the real deal. Overall I kind of feel more relaxed in general on it. Kind of at peace and stuff does not piss me off as much as usual. Give it a try. This stuff is legit. Start off slow on it at first. Your stomach needs a week or so to get use to it.

review/summary: Thank you, Natural Calm!
review/text: I have only taken this magnesium product for three days; however, within that time my heart palpitations have decreased significantly......as has my constant awareness of my heart beating.  Some people had mentioned a problem with diarrhea when using Natural Calm; however I have not been experiencing that - possibly because I am taking only 1/2 teaspoon daily.  I am satisfied with the unflavored product, likening it to a tart lemonade.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I am SO glad that I took a chance on Natural Calm!!!  A complete cardiac work-up revealed no major problems, and both my cardiologist and myself were at our wits end, trying to come up with a non-prescription remedy to address my unnerving heart beats.

review/summary: Better training recovery, much less pain, sleep like a baby
review/text: I discovered Peter Gilham's products a few months ago, and can speak for this product as well as the Osteo Calm, which adds calcium.  As a mature exerciser, recovery is always the biggest challenge, and this product eliminated my reliance on OTC anti-inflammatories.  I'm a physiologist who did contract work for a magnesium manufacturer and I've read most of the medical literature on Mg2+'s importance in the management of diabetes and vessel disease, and I don't think there's a better product than this one to address those issues. As magnesium pulls water into the gut, IMO it's the best remedy for sluggish elimination, and you must build the dose up slowly to prevent stools that are too loose.  For people with constipation, it's pretty much guaranteed to provide an immediate and permanent remedy.  And as magnesium is critical for the complete relaxation of muscle fibers, it's a first line treatment for chronic pain of any kind.  Even after months of using the Gilham Calm products, I still have to have my evening pretty much wrapped up before taking the supplement as it really knocks me out for sleep.  Deeper and more refreshed sleep is also a main objective to any chronic pain condition.<br /><br /> I switched to the Osteo Calm a couple of months ago in my desire to add a better piece to my menopausal osteoporosis prevention, and have found that product to be completely awesome also.

review/summary: A True Miracle for my 3 year old son!
review/text: I have struggled for the last year with my 3 year old son's constipation and fear of going "poo" on the potty. He also has been quite hyperactive in the past year; that coincided with a new brother (he is the middle child) as well as his efforts on potty training.  At the suggestion of my mother in law, we began using this product (1/2 tspn per day), and 10 days later, he began going poo on the potty with no problem at all, even asking to go, and went at school.  Prior to this, he would hold it because he was in so much pain when he went, and he never went away from the house!  We literaly BATTLED over going poo in the potty!  So this was the first miracle.  But then, within two days of that, he was back to my sweet, normal 3 year old boy and not so hyper and irritable.  He is smiling more, hugging us again, obeying simple rules and commands, and I feel like I have my son back!  I attribute all of this to the magnesium as we have not done anything different with his vitamins and diet than we had been doing for the last year.  He is also eating better, which I believe is because his tummy doesn't hurt as much now that he is regular.<br /><br />I do think I am going to cut back to 1/4 tspn/day though because the stools are a little looser, and he is taking 3 hour naps, so a little too sleepy.  But all in all, I am in LOVE with this product and highly recommend it for children as well as adults! My husband is about to start taking it to see if it helps with his sleep and his adult ADD that he suffers from.

review/text: I've struggled with sleep and muscle tension for years and was introduced to this power powder by a great friend (thanks hil!) who said it worked for her.  From day one, it's worked incredibly well.  I don't feel drugged or sedated, just relaxed.  I agree that it's pretty sweet and strong as far as flavor, but hey, I can deal!  Careful: it does fizz up quite a bit and can easily overflow a glass if left unchecked.  I'm really thankful to have this product as a natural alternative to the myriad of pharmacological sleep aids.  No dependence, no withdrawal, just great, relaxed, restful sleep.

review/summary: Works Great
review/text: I ordered the Original flavor.  It tastes a lot like Alka Seltzer, only stronger.  This product works really well.  Taken at the dose on the label, I did feel more relaxed and less stressed.  Once it got in my system, it was almost like taking a sleeping pill, as I would get very sleepy within an hour or so of taking it.  The problem for me was that it seemed to build up within my system.  And the relaxed mellow state I started in soon became the fatigued energy-less state.  At first, I didn't realize that it was caused by this product.  But when I stopped taking it, the extreme fatigue did stop.  I'm giving this product five stars, because it works REALLY well.  But you do have to watch your own body and adjust your dosage accordingly.  I still take this product, but just not as often, and not on a regular schedule.  Maybe that's just me.  Do try it, but just be aware of what it can do.

review/summary: Pleasing Results
review/text: Over the past few weeks, I was analyzing my typical daily nutrition and found I was lacking in magnesium. Like most Americans, I consume much more calcium than magnesium; the ratio of calcium to magnesium intake ideally needs to be 1-1.5:1. I read the reviews and thought it would be interesting to see if I could experience the calming effect on my muscles that many other reviewers have noted.<br /><br />I take two teaspoons (dissolved into a 500 mL water bottle) about an hour before I go to bed, and I do notice a calming effect. This product does not have the effect of a hypnotic or a benzodiazepine, so one should not expect it to "knock you out." Rather, I do experience a noticeable "lightening" of the muscles. As I lie in bed, I feel more comfortable and better able to focus on feeling comfortable because the muscles all throughout my body seem to be content to be in "off" mode; they are not as easily excitable as they are on my previously magnesium-deficient diet.<br /><br />I am pleased with this product and will continue taking two teapoons in water every night. I recommend this product to all who have found that they, too, are deficient in magnesium. I also agree that this product softens the stools and provides for a pleasant midday defecation. Cheers.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I have had a "twitching eyelid" problem for over a month now.  I've had that happen a few times here and there in the past, but never like this.  This was really getting bothersome, it was doing it like every 30 minutes or so for a few seconds at a time.  From the time I woke up till the time I went to bed.  It go so bad last week, I looked up again online about it...and somehow came across a forum where someone had the same problem and someone replied "you have a magnesium deficiency".  Well then I started looking up magnesium deficency and came upon this product.  I went and bought it the next day a local store.  And guess what??  My eye twitching has almost completely come to a STOP!!!  From something that was getting to be every 20-30 min. to now it does it about 2-3 times a day, much less noticable too, the twitching isn't as severe or bothersome.<br /><br />So I would have given this 5 stars, but I am still waiting to see if this supplement helps with any of the other problems, I've noticed after reading about magnesium deficiencies.  Those would be an added bonus if it helped with my other symptoms.  I am starting out with a small amount and will work my way up, and see if it gets any better with other things.  But I think it's great for just helping with my eye, it was literally driving me crazy!!<br />So glad I came upon this product...and the taste is really not bad at all.  I mix it with a whole glass of cold water, and it really only tastes like water with a lemon wedge in it, to me anyway...Maybe a larger amount of it, in less water might be too sweet, but it's really diluted in a full glass of water, so it isn't bad at all.

review/summary: One of the best nutritional supplements out there
review/text: A friend recommended that I try this product out due to my low blood levels of magnesium (some of the medications I was on depleted my body of Mg and K). I used to get cramping and soreness in my muscles after going for just minor walks or workouts. This product however, stopped the discomfort within hours of first taking it!<br /><br />If you read up on the side effects of low levels of Magnesium in the blood, you will be amazed to find out how many ailments result. The "Calm" is the answer without a doubt.<br /><br />I suffered from high blood pressure and hypertension for years, as well as an elevated heart rate. After taking this product, in conjunction to lifestyle changes, I began to feel better and all other cardiovascular issues normalized.<br /><br />When my doctor asked me what I changed in my life to make my numbers look better, I told her about the Calm, and she has since began using it herself and telling her other patients about it. Its a much quicker and easier way to get the essential Magnesium into your body fast and effectively. It certainly works better than trying to eat copious amounts of other Mg rich foods.<br /><br />Adhere to the serving sizes- especially at first. Magnesium makes for a darn good laxative if you take too much!!!<br /><br />This product is the cheapest here on Amazon. You'll likely spend $35-$45 at other health food stores.

review/summary: What else would you call this but "Calm?"
review/text: I had high hopes when I ordered this supplement, purportedly for one of my sons who was having some transitional stress issues...but I needed it as much (if not more.)  We have not been disappointed.  In fact, this supplement has exceeded all  hopes and expectations.  I suspect that my anxiety issues were beginning to negatively impact an important relationship. That has improved as have all my other relationships.  I am much more patient and centered, much less needy.  I have also noticed that there are no more occasional heart palpitations, no more twitchy legs either...no twitches of any kind. Also, as a budding middle-aged runner, this product IS helpful with muscle recovery.  I wish we had known about this product when our younger son was running track and cross country in high school.  It would have been tremendously helpful.  As others have noted, "Calm" is a wonderful aid in getting a restful night's sleep. A good night's sleep in-and-of itself is tremendously important to one's overall health. I will try never let myself run out of this supplement.  What a discovery!

review/summary: Hooked on this!
review/text: I'm a huge skeptic, but after 6 months of daily use, I do agree that this stuff is a necessary supplement in my life.  When I skip a couple days, I'm reminded.  I take it at night and it improves my otherwise slow system by the morning.  I continued being skeptical but noticed a marked improvement in my sleeping (more relaxed) and some muscle damage I had in my leg quickly healed (after one year of pain from an injury!).  I started off slow and had to graduate to a high dose - appx 3-4 tsp per day (was having serious constipation) -- after a week or so, I tapered down to a normal dose. I got my husband hooked on this stuff for the 'relaxing' effect alone (he is on the higher energy side).  It's subtle, not a drugged feeling when I say relaxing effect ... it's similar to melatonin without any groggy feeling.  My primary use is for constipation ... no more garbage over the counter drugs.  I never found improvement from pro-biotics either. This stuff helps with bloating and overall "uggh" feeling.  We both really like the taste, too.  If you like it more sweet/sour, then just use less water.  It's an artificial type sweetener, so no calories ... and I normally hate artificial sweetener taste, but it's hidden well.  It's similar to crystal light ... we get the raspberry/lemon flavor.  We take one dose every night.  I highly recommend!  Your local health food store might give you a sample ... try it for a few days but don't buy it from there ... come to Amazon because it's WAY cheaper :)  Good luck!

review/summary: Anxiety Gone! A MUST for everyone!
review/text: I have just ended a 2+ year custody battle. Needless to say I have anxiety & I'm set off at the slightest thing. Then this little miracle fell into my lap. I was prepared for disappointment- didn't happen! The anxiety & edginess I had become all too familiar with has vanished. This affect is achieved with your very 1st dose. I now feel calm, literally. I no longer feel agitated. I no longer bite peoples head off. AND to top it all off I am sleeping soundly through the night EVERY night. No waking up, no tossing & turning, just solid, sound sleep. Thank you FIRST Magazine for this reccommendation!

It is one of the best supplements I have taken; even with my bad neck I am sleeping deeper than at anytime in my life since I was a small child and still wake up feeling refreshed. I preferred the organic orange to the lemon raspberry but it's only available in smaller containers, however it is a monthly must-buy for me.

review/summary: Helped Spouse That Has Fibromyalgia
review/text: I originally purchased Natural Calm to help with my own insomnia and anxiety issues. I started out with 1/2 teaspoon and gradually worked up to 1 teaspoon taken before bedtime. If I take more than 1 teaspoon, it has a laxative effect the next day. Even though it does help me relax, it doesn't really help with the insomnia. I've recently switched to Slow-Mag for a more sustained release of magnesium throughout the day. It doesn't have the same laxative effect, plus helps with daytime anxiety. However, my spouse (who has fibromyalgia) has had positive results with Natural Calm. It has improved his quality of sleep and also helped with muscle aches and overall fatigue. He takes about 1 to 1/2 teaspoons each night. I anticipate that he will want to continue purchasing Natural Calm. It doesn't work the same for everyone, but we are very happy with how the product has helped him so far.

review/summary: Finally good sleep
review/text: I'm a 31 year old woman and I have suffered from night terrors for my entire life. Since I started taking this supplement a couple of weeks ago I've slept through the night every night. Aside from that fact (that will keep me a customer for life on its own), I also just feel great in general. I take a teaspoon in the morning and a teaspoon in the evening which i dissolve in warm water. It tastes like a bland lemonade, which is fine by me. I'm not here for the flavor, i'm here for the health benefits. My bathroom trips are more regular and my muscles don't feel as sore after I exercise. One thing I would like to note, just in case it happens for anyone else, is that the first 3 days I was getting a pain in my temple randomly throughout the day. Research has led me to believe that this was from the artificial sweetener in the raspberry lemonade flavoring. I'm not having those pains anymore, and when I order again i'll probably stick with the same flavor. I hope this helps someone else may be on the fence about it.

I've been taking it every day for about a year now(so has my husband) and we have been sleeping better, and I truly do feel a bit more relaxed. I also started taking it in the morning and evening and have noticed I have been having less panic attacks.  I am not saying it "cured" them, but I definitely have noticed a difference (for the better) in severity and occurence.  I have not missed a "dose" in months.  This stuff rocks!

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I had been eating pumpkin seeds for magnesium for a while, but there are times when I want to get the mineral without a bunch of added calories (like late at night before bed). This stuff is great for that. It doesn't upset my stomach like a magnesium pill sometimes can, and it tastes good, and has no sugar. Maybe it is just placebo effect, but it seems like my teeth are smoother after I swish it around in my mouth for a while. Also, it sometimes helps me relax. I certainly will continue to buy it regularly. I recommend it to my family but none of them listen to me; their loss!

review/summary: Might be working?
review/text: I am an anxiety ridden person who just needs to calm down, so I tried this.  I think it has helped a little with restful sleep.  It also impacts bowel movements, so watch your dosage.  Read the directions: it needs to fizz in warm water before you drink it.  There's a raspberry-lemon flavor I would probably have liked better but didn't see it until after I ordered.  The flavor is bitter but it's such a small drink (2-3 oz) that it's acceptable.<br />I think valerian root works better for immediate relief.  This needs a longer time period to work well.

review/summary: Don't want to live without this
review/text: My daughter (who worked at a natural foods store as the supplements specialist) recommended this to me to help with muscle spasms, and it's really been of great benefit. After going through two 8oz packages, I was unable to afford it for a while. I really felt a difference without taking my Calm Plus Calcium twice a day. I found it much harder to relax and sleep at night, and started having spasms in my leg and back again. Recently purchased this 16 oz container thru Amazon, and have been taking it regularly again, and finally the spasms are mostly gone again. I hope they never stop making this product - I suppose I could live without it, but I would rather not!

review/summary: one of my favorite supplements
review/text: Magnesium deficiency can affect all aspects of health. I have tried various magnesium supplements, and this is my favorite. I feel, as the label says in bold letters, more CALM when I take this. There is less muscle tension in my body. I enjoy the taste as well, mixed with just 3-4 ounces of hot water, for a soothing warm lemon drink. I often take this with my calcium hydroxyapatite supplements, since both will work better together.<br /><br />Down sides: Need to be careful when making it, or it will fizz itself up and out of your cup. Also, if you get loose stools, adjust your dose down because it means you are taking more than you can absorb. Unfortunately, this is also a sign that your body isn't ABLE to absorb magnesium properly, in which case you may need to look into temporary IV or topical formulas until this is addressed.

review/summary: Great for sore muscles, helps with sleep, helps with menstrual cramps.
review/text: I've been using Natural Vitality Calm magnesium powder for years. It helps me get to sleep at night, especially after a stressful day or when I'm worried. I use it after I work out at the gym; or if I've got sore muscles from other activities such as gardening or heavy lifting. It is great for "that time of the month." It helps with cramps and mood swings. Calm comes in a few different flavors such as lemon, raspberry-lemon, and orange. I like the orange flavor the best. It's easy to use. Just mix a teaspoon or more of the powder with hot water. Then add a little cold water or cold juice and drink.  A hint: If you have trouble sleeping, try taking Calm and also take Vitamin B1 about a half hour before bed, to help with sleep. My chiropractor recommended that and it works for me. The magnesium in Calm has been formulated to absorb into the body and take effect quickly. There is a little booklet that is usually attached to the canister of Calm that gives more info on all of the benefits of magnesium in this form.

review/text: I'm so glad my doctor told me about this stuff.  I was having high blood pressure, anxiety attacks, just stressed out.  Also losing my hair but I haven't been taking it long enough to tell if that will help with this problem.  But, I'm not on blood pressure meds anymore, and I just feel calm, just as it is called.  Work has, and still is, very stressful, but this stuff helps me get through the day without the need to go home and have a glass of wine, or something stronger, every day.  It does not make me sleepy (I was afraid of that happening at work), but it does help me sleep better through the night.  I'm now hoping that this, in addition to some other things I'm taking, will help with my hair loss.

Great discount for buying in bulk.<br /><br />I add "Da'Bomb The Final Answer Hot Sauce" when I make it.  Just a tiny bit on the edge of a knife makes this into a "Spicy Chicken" flavor that is irresistible to a chilihead like me.

review/text: I made these with my children, and the kids loved them as much as I did.  Added benefit other then wonderful taste and texture was that they made the house smell incredible.  My neice came over and wanted to stay for the day.  Only issue is they seem to be unavailable or seasonal, which is a shame, as I would order these all the time, as they were really good.

review/summary: wild hibiscus flowers
review/text: These Wild Hibiscus Flowers make an impressive statement in cocktails, especially champagne.  In addition, the flowers are edible and yummy!!!!  You can even float them in sparkling apple cider or bubbling water for those non-alcoholic drinkers, as well as the kids.  Great way to spark conversation among your guests.  They make a wonderful hostess gift as well.

review/summary: Fabulous and Decadent
review/text: I saw these wonderful flowers in champagne drinks the last time I was in Las Vegas, namely Wynn and Vdara.  After an extensive search online I found the Australian website that carried them, and immediately bought a jar.  The flowers are delicious but do not change the flavor of the drink being served.  Perfect for straight champagne or any other drink that would have bubbles.  The jar also comes with other serving ideas.

review/summary: Great taste and awesome look
review/text: Bought these to try them out for our signature wedding cocktail.  We put 1 in the bottom of a champagne glass, did NOT add any additional syrup that the flowers are packed in, and filled the glass with champagne.  The end result is a lovely pinky colored drink with a great treat at the end!  The flower itself has a great taste.  I did try 1 drink with adding a tidbit of syrup and I found it made the drink very sweet and very dark colored.  I prefered just using the flower alone (which has some syrup attached to it unless you wash it off).  That tiny amount of syrup that coats the flower gave the drinks the perfect pink color we were looking for without making it sweet.  It really is a great look!

review/text: I was recently at the home of a friend for dinner. I brought along a bottle of Prosecco. My host handed me my champagne flute and it was rose colored. I said" I thought it was white", she said she had added a wild hibiscus flower to the bottom of the flute causing the rose color. When I got to the bottom of the glass I ate this delicious flower and that's all it took for me to be hooked. I came to Amazon and bought a bottle immediately. If you read up about how this business started in Australia you will be most impressed. The flowers gently open as the bubbles surround them and they taste divine!!

review/text: I first had Udi's white sandwich bread at a restaurant.  I spit it out because it was so good that I was sure they must have screwed up and given me regular bread.  But they hadn't, and thus began my love affair with Udi's bread.<br /><br />My husband doesn't have celiac disease but he still loves this bread.  The only reason he doesn't eat it all the time is because of the expense.<br /><br />The ends/heels of this bread can be hard so I grind them up in my food processor and freeze them for later use in recipes that call for bread crumbs.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: I had this recommended to me by mutliple people as the best gluten-free bread since I had given up on find a decent gluten-free bread.  Gluten is the heart of breads and pastas, so, doing without it, never gives exactly the same taste and texture.  However, this is hands down the best gluten-free bread that I've eaten.  It is good enough that my wife and kids actually love eating it.  They say that, while it is a little different than regular bread, they very much like it.  Still, we buy ours at Whole Foods for $5/12oz-loaf.

review/text: This is the best gluten free bread you can buy. It taste as close to "real" (wheat flour) bread as you can get. It makes great croutons and toasts up nicely.<br />The down side is that the only store in town I can get it at is Whole Foods who charge $7 for a small loaf. I use amazon and take advantage of the automatic ordering savings to stay stocked up on most of the gluten free products that I use on a regular basis to save money but no dice on this item. It is almost twice as much as Hole in your Wallet Foods (when you can't beat them you are wayyyyyy over charging) and they don't offer the automatic ordering savings on Udis.

review/summary: Intense Ginger Experience and Digestive Aid
review/text: *****<br /><br />This Organic Ginger Tea from Yogi Tea is ideal as a digestive aid, and it also purportedly enhances circulation. It's a lovely, intense, all natural herbal tea made from organic ginger root, organic lemon grass, orgnaic licorice root, organic peppermint leaf, and organic black pepper. The taste is exactly like ginger, spicy and peppery, with sweet overtones. It's very nice anytime, but especially after a meal.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Ginger Organic Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Our 100% Organic Ginger tea has something to offer to anyone who wants to get or stay healthy. For millennia, herbalists from all over the world have known of the healing, soothing and energizing qualities of this root, considered the "universal medicine."  Organic Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used worldwide as a safe and mild home remedy for a variety of conditions, including motion sickness, occasional upset stomach and intestinal gas, as well as minor menstrual cramps. Ayurvedic practitioners have used Ginger for years as a way of activating the body's fire element (Agni), which burns up Ama (the body's toxins, comprised of both undigested food and naturally occurring toxins). When Ama is decreased, the body gains strength, balance and harmony. As a natural warming energizer, Ginger is also known to support the immune system, promote rapid and complete digestion and increase intestinal tone and peristalsis.  Furthermore, it works as an antioxidant and has been shown to safely and effectively relieve nausea associated with motion. Our 100% Organic Ginger tea tastes delicious and provides the highest quality of a timeless remedy."<br /><br />There is a warning on the box that if you have indigestion or heartburn that persists you should see a doctor. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Good, warming tea
review/text: This is a good tea to drink in the winter because it is quite warming.  The ginger, licorice root, black pepper, are all very good at warming the body through.  It took me a while to get used to having pepper in my tea, but now that I have I like the little kick of spice it adds.  I don't even add honey anymore.  Some might consider this to be a very "biting" tea.  This is why I say it is good for winter.  I've bought it during the summer and feel it would be more satisfying in cooler weather.  I have to say that I won't buy again because of the pepper, but this reflects a personal preference, not impression of quality.<br /><br />Yogi Tea uses organic ingredients and 100% recycled cardboard for their attractive packaging.  They are a company based out of Oregon.<br /><br />I couldn't say how well it helps with digestion, as I don't drink it on a regular basis.  But we all know that ginger is very good for the body.

review/summary: Lifesaver For My Dairy, Nut and Egg Allergic Child and Delicious!
review/text: What can I say except that this cake mix is delicious and a lifesaver. My son is allergic to dairy, nut and egg so he cannot eat the typical cake and has to sit out at cake time at birthday parties. I searched for a substitute for him and for his own parties and came up with some good concoctions but nothing really tasted "normal" enough for all the kids to enjoy.  This, however, is outrageously delicious and makes great cake and cupcakes and I haven't had a single kid notice the difference. I do notice the difference, however, between this and a store made cake and this beats any typical store cake. It uses belgian chocolate, which I think compensates for the lack of egg or dairy. It comes out dense and rich, almost a hybrid of a cake and brownie and we love it and use it for all special occasions. Also, a few tips... I like lowfat stuff and I have started substituting applesauce for the bulk of the oil. I cook it a little longer to firm it up but it comes out awesome. Also, the odd thing is that a number of Pillsbury frostings do not have egg or dairy in them.  Although full of chemicals and a contradiction to the pureness of this mix, I have used them and I think it gives the cupcakes/cake a familiar taste to other kids so that they have no hint that this is a vegan mix.  I, on the other hand, love it without any frosting, still warm, served with either soy ice cream or some lowfat frozen yogurt. Its just great and as I say it has been a lifesaver in that it has brought normalcy to special events that had previously been very challenging in terms of figuring out what to serve that my son could eat.  We've gotten many compliments on this case.

review/summary: A Really Great Cake Mix For Vegans!
review/text: I'm a professionally trained pastry chef, and I have to say I was blown away at the high quality of the product. I'm usually averse to using mixes, but the Cherrybrook Kitchen products do a great job at balancing exceptional flavor with non-dairy ingredients.<br /><br />I've baked out the chocolate cake, yellow cake and brownie mixes several times and they always come out as expected. The frosting mixes are also exceptional and offer room for modulating the ingredients if you prefer to use butter/margarine blends for richness - not vegan, I know, but the flavor isn't lost either way.<br /><br />The sugar content is low, which helps to keep the calorie count down on these cakes - for those dieting, or watching their sugar intake. Overall, I highly recommend these cake and frosting mixes.<br /><br />A note about baking:  home ovens vary in temperature for a variety of reasons. If you suspect that your oven temps are not what they should be, invest in an oven thermometer to make sure you are heating to the proper temps. These mixes absolutely perform as the written instructions provide, but you need to make sure you preheat and reach the correct temperatures, and then maintain them by not opening the oven door constantly.

review/text: No worries about having to order ANY of these mixes in bulk lots of 6!  They are great to have in stock and you will want to share them with friends.<br /><br />I do not have any food allergies, yet I have loved this chocolate cake since a friend made one for me years ago.  You might not even need to frost this cake!  I have always served it right from the pan, so I cannot attest to the difficulty or ease of turning the single layer cake out onto a platter.  Leaving it in the pan may also help it set up correctly in the center; I use a 9 inch (not 8) metal (not glass) round pan and am able to follow the suggested cooking times in my electric oven.<br /><br />Added bonus: the graphics on the box are so great I can store these in plain sight on my kitchen hutch!

review/summary: cook time wrong
review/text: The box says to cook this for 25 minutes on 350 in a round metal pan until a toothpick comes out clean.  I have cooked 4 of them now.  The first was ruined because I did 25 min. and the toothpick was only wet looking on the tip, so I assumed I hit a chocolate chip.  But, after it cooled when I tipped over the pan to get the cake out, it fell apart and there was a about a layer in the middle towards the bottom that was not cooked.  The second one I kept checking and the toothpick didn't come out clean until 40 minutes.  The cake didn't taste that great, because most of it was overcooked.  I just cooked 2 more for my nieces birthday tomorrow and it also took 40 minutes for toothpick to come out clean.  I am hoping they taste okay.  At least she likes them, but I do wish that it cooked more evenly so that parts of it weren't either overdone or underdone.

review/text: Because my 2-year-old has a peanut allergy, we keep our home nut-free.  I got this cake mix, and the frosting by the same company, for my stepdaughter's graduation cake, and it exceeded my expectations.  Not only is it nut-free, dairy-free, gluten-free, and whatever-else-free, it tastes GREAT!  Everyone loved this cake!

review/summary: Very good chocolate cake
review/text: I believe I prefer this cake mix to the regular ones.  I grew up on home made cakes and am not crazy about cake mixes, but I'm lazy.  I tried this one because its peanut free and we have an allergy in the household.  Much to my surprise I really liked the cake.  It's moist.  I doesn't taste fake like most mixes.  Its not overly sweet.  And its wonderful rich chocolate but not overly sweet.  I really appreciated not having to have eggs or milk, since I don't always have those items in the house.<br /><br />The cooking time was a bit of a problem.  I don't remember how much longer it took than the directions, at least 5 minutes, probably longer.  If your toothpick comes out wet, believe it.  It isn't done yet.

review/summary: I am not vegan, no dietary restc., but..
review/text: Ok, I do not have any special dietary needs, but my best friend needs to eat gluten free foods. So, I did started researching and making sure I included things in my pantry for her and her daughter. The really cool thing, is it changed a few things for the better in my house for my family. I love this cake mix!! It saves me sone time, but none of the crap in the regulas mixes. So, when I do not have time or lack ingredients to make my own, I dress this up with my own style and make it mine! Semi-Homade As Sandra Lee says! My son loves these mixes and perfers them to store bought, which I do not like to do!! Also, buy it in bulk here, cuz in the store one box can cost you up to 5.99!! The Frosting Mix is really good as well! I have made it as a royal icing and used organic non-salted butter for the more fluffy frosting! DO NOT BUY THE PRE-MADE FROSTING UNTIL THEY GET THE RECIPE RIGHT!!! YUCK!!

review/summary: Good, as long as you get what you order!
review/text: I would never order this from Amazon again, although I will buy this cake mix again.  The mix itself was great.  HOWEVER...<br /><br />I ordered this for my daughter's birthday party with her grandparents.  When we arrived and I opened the package, I realized that instead of the package of six, we had ONE. (We had ordered some other mixes, so it wasn't obvious until I opened the box.)  Twenty minutes on the phone with someone who spoke decent English with a slight Indian accent was supposed to get us a new box of six cake mixes.  The cake mixes arrived two days later than expected, toward the end of our trip.  (Could have been T.S. Faye woes?) The even bigger problem?  We received the gluten free mix, which is okay I guess (doesn't taste as good) but not at all what I ordered.  I didn't really want to mess with it after that.  I bought these to save a little money over the huge price in our grocery store, but I spent WAY more, when you consider that I only received one box of the product I ordered.<br /><br />P.S. - the cake mix itself is excellent.

I have not seen them here and I have almost used them all up. They are a wonderful smooth tea for those who do not want the caffeine, I use them as an infusion, fill a water bottle with cold filtered water, add a tea bag and let it set for an hour or so, good for hot days or for a after workout refresher. They are so good you don't need to add anything. Nice hot or cold.<br />Great flavors, wonderful smells and beautiful colors. Sure to become a favorite!

We were introduced to Garganelli Pasta there which we were told is specially made in a region just outside of Rome. Needless to say we stocked up but soon run out after a few months. We have tried looking everywhere for it in Hong Kong and China with no luck.  By chance decide to try Amazon, and found EuroGrocer. We could not believe our luck! And better yet, as it turns out they went out of their way to redirect the package at my request after it had already been picked up by DHL. And kept me informed of the progress. I trully appreciate good service and this is a shinning example.  With staff like Ellen, I definitely rate them a 5 star.

review/summary: Long-lasting flavor in a xylitol gum
review/text: I've tried five flavors of Spry gum: peppermint, spearmint, green tea, fresh fruit, and cinnamon. Cinnamon is by far my favorite. The flavor lasts for longer than any of the other Spry flavors. The warming effect of cinnamon oil also offsets the cooling effect of xylitol, making it not feel as strange in the mouth.<br /><br />I really like that the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. It's great that I can chew this without having intestinal problems.

review/summary: Yummy way to save your teeth
review/text: Let's face it.  No one wants to get bad news from the dentist.  Proper dental care can go a long way to keeping one's teeth for a lifetime.<br /><br />The generation that grew up in the Depression and World War II many times did not have good dental care.  No fluoride, sealants, waterpiks, sonic toothbrushes and the like.  It wasn't uncommon for a person in their 30s to be missing a few teeth.  People generally could look forward to wearing dentures as their teeth became so rotten, the only thing to do was to pull them.<br /><br />Today, we don't have such problems.  And one of the reasons is the use of xylitol to help kill the bacteria that cause tooth decay.  The main reason for dental decay is a bacterium called S. Mutans.  This bug feeds on sugars and starches, secreting acids which destroy tooth enamel, which leads to decay and cavities.  There are various ways to defeat this bug, brushing, fluoride, flossing and sealants all have their place.<br /><br />A more modern addition to the decay-preventing fight is xylitol.  It's a sugar alcohol that S. Mutans cannot digest.  Sucking on mints or chewing gum with xylitol a few times a day is a easy and tasty way to curb this nasty bacteria.<br /><br />I've been chewing xylitol gum and eating xylitol mints for a number of years, and I've noticed that my dental problems have really improved.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  My only complaint is that this gum is so delicious, I tend not to ration it to make it last longer.  Try Spry.  Your mouth will thank you for it.  (Maybe not your dentist, though).

review/summary: Everything from China
review/text: Personally, I have read too much and heard too many news reports about the lack of valid oversight in China when it comes to the health and safety of their products and ingredients (from medicines to food to children's toys...) for me to be comfortable with their products. This is a personal decision because for me, health is paramount in life.<br /><br />Here is part of an email I received from Xlear about their products in answer to my questions about the origin of their products:<br /><br />"Good Afternoon,<br /><br />The raw Xylitol comes from China, shipped to Orem, UT and that is where we make the Xlear Nasal Spray.  Our Gum, Mints and Candies are all made in China. The rest of our products are made here in the states.  I hope that was the information you were looking for. Have a nice day!<br /><br />Xlear Inc."<br /><br />I find this especially troubling because the nasal spray has a big red, white and blue shield that says "Made in the USA." So all the ingredients come from China and are put together in Utah. Can this really be legal? To say "Made in the USA" when all the ingredients are from China?<br /><br />If it is 'legal' to say this (yes, we have big problems with our own FDA)...it is still unethical in my opinion. Deceptive, misleading. Sigh...American business and politics. Maybe we should all just move to China. And get jobs in their factories.

But there is really no comparison since we don't use these types of gum.  My whole family loves it, from my husband and I to our 6 year old and teenager. Our second flavor is peppermint.

review/summary: Good for what I needed, but the flavor does not last
review/text: I wanted this gum because studies have shown xylitol reduces tooth decay (see Wikipedia quote below).  I put this in my kids' lunch, because they have had some issues with cavities, and despite my begging that they brush at lunch, I am very sure they are not.  I take this gum also, and I chew it after my lunch.  I know my kids will chew this, even if the flavor doesn't last long, because it's gum- and all gum is better than no gum.  On the negatives side, if you are looking for a gum that stays soft and chewy and flavorful for a long time, this isn't it.  I like the flavor- it's not bitter like some cinnamon gums, but I can't say it lasts long.  I chew it, feel it freshens my breath and may help my teeth, and the pretty quickly, when it starts to taste like unflavored rubber, I spit it out.<br /><br />what follows is from wiki:<br /><br />Xylitol is a "toothfriendly" sugar. In addition to not encouraging tooth decay (by replacing dietary sugars), xylitol may actively aid in repairing minor cavities caused by dental caries.[citation needed] Early studies from Finland in the 1970s found that a group chewing sucrose gum had 2.92 decayed, missing, or filled (dmf) teeth compared to 1.04 in the group chewing xylitol gums. In another study, researchers had mothers chew xylitol gum 3 months after delivery until their children were 2 years old. The researchers found that the xylitol group had "a 70% reduction in caries (dmf)." Recent research confirms a plaque-reducing effect and suggests that the compound, having some chemical properties similar to sucrose, attracts and then "starves" harmful micro-organisms, allowing the mouth to remineralize damaged teeth with less interruption. (However, this same effect also interferes with yeast micro-organisms and others, so xylitol is inappropriate for making yeast-based bread, for instance.)<br /><br />Xylitol based products are allowed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make the medical claim that they do not promote dental caries.[9]

I eat two of these every time and the flavor is gone literally within about one minute (that is probably even a bit generous). I would not recommend this gum to anyone. The cinnamon flavor is amazing initially, but, as I said, the flavor lasts so briefly it is not worth it at all. If you are just getting this because you want to chew on something, go ahead and buy this, but don't expect flavor.

review/summary: Good Stuff! Make Sure You Keep Away From Dogs!
review/text: This has amazing taste! Even though there have been double blind studies showing it reduces cavities xylitol is controversial. I chew it because I have low saliva production. Ten minutes every hour, ten hours a day increases saliva production, which protects gums and teeth. It is thought that mouth bacteria can't ferment it, which is the reason it reduces cavities.<br /><br />Xylitol to dogs is deadly, so I am very careful to keep Xlear Spry gum where they can NEVER get to it, and disposing the used gum into the trash out in the garage. In dogs, Xylitol is toxic. Just 3 grams can kill a 65 pound dog. In about 30 minutes (give or take) of a dog eating something containing xylitol, their blood sugar begins droping to dangerous levels. Symptoms are weakness, lethargy, loss of coordination, collapse and seizures. An IMMEDIATE trip to the vet is needed, otherwise there is little chance your dog will survive. This doesn't affect cats.<br /><br />Another thing to consider with xylitol, is that it does thin the blood in humans. People on blood thinners, such as myself should consult their doctors before consuming Xlear Spry or any xylitol containing items.<br /><br />That said, Xlear Spry gum is really good, I especially like the cinnamon flavor. I love the flavor! Also, there are no Phenylketonurics (known cancer causing ingredients) in Spry.

This has a nice peppery, cinnamon flavor to start but only lasts a few minutes.  Maybe this is the true cost of a natural flavoring?  My "go to" brand lasts and lasts but is probably killing me on the inside.  The quest for a true cinnamon gum continues.

review/summary: Great Gum
review/text: This is a great gum.  I like the cinnamon flavor best.  The mint flavors would be my #2 choice.  No sugar, and Xylitol is supposed to be good for your teeth, so win-win. It does lose it's flavor, but not much more quickly than some other gums.  I usually chew two peices at a time as they are a bit small. The Spry mints are also good.  I like the mint flavors, but my kids like the fruity ones.

review/summary: nice but could be improved
review/text: Being a guy that chews gum everyday i was looking for a healthier alternative to my usual ''dentyne ice'' those small rectangular hard pieces of gum.  I found spry and thought i hit the jackpot.  When you open the container , first thing you will notice are the gum pieces are much smaller than dentyne ice , then when you first try it the flavor is very nice like a milder version of ''big red'', but thats where it stops, the flavor is sucked out of it in about 20 seconds and you will need to pop about 3 of these just to feel like you are chewing on something.  My suggestion is make them about 1/3 bigger and do something to make the flavor last a bit longer.  They're supposedly good for your teeth so ill use up my order and possibly order them again if i dont find a better version of this gum.

review/text: This gum is good, however, the flavor does not last long. This is not a problem as there are 100 pieces BUT, and I warn you, be cautious when consuming more than a few pieces in a day. You could be in for an eventful surprise. The sugar substitutes that end in "ol" (like "Xylitol") are sugar alcohols and these can pull liquid into the bowel and cause diarrhea and other digestive upsets. Google for more information or try for yourself!

Taste was great- strong, cinnamon flavor (think Big Red). The taste did not last, but it did linger in a pleasant way (cinnamon oil). No weird after taste whatsoever. Choosing this over Glee!

review/text: I love cinnamon flavored gum so I was excited about this being a natural sugar free version.  It has great flavor but the flavor only lasts about 5 minutes and then it tastes like I'm just chewing a piece of wax. Also, the pieces are kind of small so I chew two pieces at a time in order to feel like I'm chewing a substantial enough piece of gum.  Probably won't buy this again.

review/summary: Good flavor, but short-lived
review/text: I am trying to avoid aspartame in my diet, but most sugar-free gum contains it. This gum uses only Xylitol as the sweetener.  It is very strong at first (I purchased cinnamon flavor), but the flavor subsides quickly.  If you keep it in your mouth though, you begin to taste it again.  Maybe the initial strength deadens the taste buds temporarily. One upside is that it isn't nearly as sticky or soft as other gums, so it doesn't make a mess trying to throw it away.  Make sure you keep it away from pets, because Xylitol is toxic for dogs.

review/summary: Healthy Chewing Gum with Good Flavor
review/text: Since I was a kid, I have loved chewing sugarless gum. I have read that it is a good habit, as it helps clean your teeth after meals and prevent cavities, and may even help prevent acid reflux. Chewing cinnamon gum has even been shown to boost mental performance in a study. However, I became concerned about the possible heath risks from artificial sweeteners like potassium acesulfame used in the gum available at local stores, so I was chewing less often. I decided to try this Xlear Spry cinnamon gum, sweetened with Xylitol. According to Wikipedeia, xylitol has a lot of heath benefits, including reducing dental caries, ear and upper respiratory infections, and Candida yeast growth; it also helps remineralize teeth and bones.  I am happy with Spry cinnamon gum as a substitute for the name-brand gums I had bought previously, though it isn't perfect.  I do have to chew two pieces, as the gum seems to shrink over time, and the flavor is pleasant but doesn't seem to be quite as strong or last as long.  Also the cost of Spry is higher, since I can't take advantage of sales and coupons like with other gum.  These are minor complaints, though, and I am happily switching my family to healthier xylitol-based gum.

review/text: I highly recommend this gum for anyone who gets aspartame headaches, or is looking for a more natural/healthy solution to typical sugarfree gums. The cinnamon flavor comes on a little strong at first, and then tends to fade rather quickly, but the sweetness/freshness of the xylitol lasts quite a long time. The dental benefits, fresh flavor, and natural ingredients are the perfect combination for me.

review/summary: Great value, good pantry staple
review/text: I really like this product. I find they soften in as little as 10 minutes or so. I simply sort through them and pull out the kind of mushrooms that I'm after (either porcini or chanterelles, for instance). The best part of using dried mushrooms is using the flavored water that the mushrooms steep in, such as pasta sauces, risotto, etc. I never throw it away.<br /><br />As to other people's comments about dirt or rocks, this is my second jar and I have never encountered that. Like dried beans, you should visually inspect the dried mushrooms before you add them to recipes; sometimes the steps do not revive well and stay tough. In general, reconstituted dried mushrooms do have a chewier texture. I encountered this when drying my own mushrooms. Some of this is just the process, not this particular product. I went to Italy last year and bought several packages of dried porcini and some of them were a bit chewy, too.<br /><br />You do get better and fresher dried mushrooms if you buy them in small quantities, but they are much, much more expensive. I use for Italian mushrooms for special occasions, and use these for my everyday cooking.

review/text: I love dried mushrooms.  All kinds of them.  But I was very disappointed in these and am trying to decide what to do with this huge container now.  They have no flavor at all.  Reconstituting is a challenge, because  the different types of mushrooms require different amounts of time to hydrate.  But I worked with them, removing the different types from the liquid as they were ready.  The problem is that they have no taste at all to them. None. Neither does the broth.  I have purchased other types of Roland dried mushrooms and been very happy with them.  These are a big disappointment.

review/text: If I'd known these were from France, I never would have ordered them. The mushrooms I received look nothing like the ones in the image on Amazon. In the image, there are a lot of golden/light brown mushrooms, all I got were very dark brown to black. The aroma and flavor seem fine, but the color indicates either they were dried at too high of a temperature, or they are very old. And there are a lot of woody stems. Either way, the flavor and nutritional value would not be what it should be. I had subscribed for regular deliveries of these, however, after getting my first jar, I'm cancelling and going to buy in bulk and mix my own in the future.

review/summary: Odd Mixture
review/text: I use dried mushrooms frequently in making soup and thought I'd give these a try.  I would say that they are not as intense in flavor as others I've used.  In addition, one of the mushrooms in the mix is a sort of flat, slippery and crunchy variety - not a good mix with the others, which are more soft and meaty in terms of texture - and I usually leave them out of whatever I'm cooking.  Possibly they'd be good in an omelette but I haven't been that adventurous.

review/text: Three stars until I actually cook w/these. Seen comments elsewhere about roland branded mushrooms regarding country of origin. Fyi - at least for the ones shipped to me it's "Product of France". Price looks good too. Typical pricing in local Chicago grocery stores tends to be $4 an ounce & up.<br /><br />Fyi II - it's white text on a light blue background but if you look carefully on the jar image at amazon.com - you can discern "France" on there. Roland reserves the right to change that?

review/summary: EXTRA GOOD! This creamy chicken "Soup at Hand" is fab!
review/text: Campbells Creamy Chicken Soup at Hand is especially tasty when you need it: if you have no appetite, are getting a cold, or feel the flu coming on! These soup at hand ready to serve soups are extreme comfort when you, or someone you love, is just not at the top of their game! When I just can't face a meal, this creamy chicken soup is perfect for making me feel better - plus it gives a sick person something tasty to wash down all those meds, syrups, and other yucky stuff. And hot soup is so soothing when fighting a cold, flu, or just the "under the weather" feeling. This creamy chicken flavor is extra tasty for the amount of calories, too! Recommended!<br />Calories 130 (per unit)<br />4 grams protein<br />890 mg sodium<br />13 carbs<br />9 grams fat<br />with 62% of calories from fat (which is ok when this is all you can have)

review/text: This is strictly a product of convenience, for it tastes about as you might expect (or perhaps worse) of something in styrofoam from a microwave.  I wasn't expecting a gourmet experience, but on the other hand I wasn't expecting chicken soup that tastes like some high school chemistry experiment gone horribly wrong.  A much better solution would be to buy yourself a ream of styrofoam cups and a dozen cans of Campbell's cream of chicken soup.  If you can afford the 30 seconds with a can opener and a spoon, you'll be rewarded with something that provides a reasonable facsimile of the taste of real soup.

review/text: I love this soup. I only tried it recently and went back to my local store to buy more. I have found locally that different stores carry different varieties of the Campbell's Soup At Hand and the Creamy Chicken is not carried at all my local stores, so I was very glad to find it at Amazon. Although it does not contain much actual chicken, this soup has a wonderful chicken flavor. It is so creamy and good and tastes like real comfort food. It is great for a quick lunch or dinner, either alone or combined with a salad or sandwich. I almost wish Campbell's made it available in larger cans, but that's true of all the Soup At Hand flavors.<br /><br />I hope that Amazon will continue to carry these soups, as the price is much better per container (about $1.30 each) than the individual prices at some of the larger grocers.

review/text: I am a fan of Caffe D'Vita instant cappucino mix.  I have tried the caramel and pumpkin spice and I loved them both.  The irish cream flavor is not really to my liking because it's a little too dark and not what I expected.  I was thinking it would be a little bit sweeter, similar to International Delight (or similar) non dairy creamers.  It's nothing like that at all.  I either make it weak or doctor it up and still it's only just ok.  Likely I could buy the creamer mentioned and take the edge off this flavor.  I will continue to order this brand but not this flavor.

review/summary: Tasty orange soda - zero cal - and all-natural!
review/text: I happen to be drinking an Orange Zevia as I write this review.  :)<br /><br />I cannot compliment this brand enough.  I've been purchasing all flavors of Zevia for the past few years and absolutely love it.  There isn't an aftertaste at all, and it is simply delicious.  Zevia's Natural Orange is among my favorite flavors.  My other Zevia favorites are black cherry and root beer, however all their flavors are yummy!<br /><br />My favorite things about Zevia are that they are sweetened with all-natural stevia and do not contain any harmful chemicals.  Also, I love the fact that there are not any calories in it.  There are no artificial colors or flavors either.<br /><br />The only Zevia flavor I've seen caffeine in is cola.  All the others are caffeine-free.<br /><br />I deducted a star from this product due to the pricey price point of Zevia. I still continue to buy it, but not as often as I would like to due to the cost.<br /><br />I have emailed the Zevia corporate team and they are responsive, professional, and friendly. I trust this brand.<br /><br />I hope you give Zevia a try. I think you will be pleased!

review/text: What distinguishes this soda from the other diet soda's is that it does NOT elevate your blood sugars. Despite the fact that there are other Zero calorie soda's, they have Aspertame or Splenda which DOES raise your blood sugar levels - so this is really the best soda for those who have this concern.<br /><br />Also, unless you are truly living without sugar, this soda won't taste as good to you as others. It tastes MUCH better when you aren't ingesting either sugar or sugar substitutes.<br /><br />Best thing - EVERYTHING IN THIS IS ALL NATURAL!! Enjoy:)

review/text: My family loves this soda.  We sometimes buy it from a nearby grocery store.  HOWEVER,  I had it shipped from Amazon and it is no good.  I believe that somewhere in the process of getting to my home the Zevia Orange may be getting too hot.  It was very hot weather the first time it was shipped to me.  It really tastes weird...not like when we buy if off the shelf.  I tried again in cold weather this time and though it's not as bad, it is still no good. It has an odd bite to it that I assume comes from it getting too warm.  It alters the beverage and cooling it in the frig does not reverse it.

review/summary: If Stevia is bitter for you, then this is the better tasting Zevia drinks
review/text: Because of my genetics Stevia will always be bitter to me. I've tried other artificial sweeteners and stevia is by far the worse in bitterness no matter what brand I try.  I get no sweet taste at all. However, I have to limit my sugar intake, and sometimes I just get tired of other drinks, especially the carbonated ones. I like the orange Zevia because with the bitter Stevia taste it reminds me a lot of the "bitter orange" or lightly sweetened orange sodas that I got in Europe. I haven't tried the lemon or lime flavors, but I imagine the citrus lends itself well to the bitter flavor.

One case had a can that had ruptured, soaking the inside of the box, and the cardboard had begun to mold as a result.  Yuck.  It was not a particularly hot day when it was delivered, between that and the mold I'm sure the can burst long before it arrived at my door.<br /><br />Another case not only had a ruptured can, but was missing one as well!  One of the four sixpacks had only five cans, and an empty plastic ring where a sixth should have been.<br /><br />Maybe the packagers got thirsty.

review/text: When I was a kid, I loved Orange Crush.  Now, I don't drink soda with sugar and diet sodas contain a chemical sweetener of some sort that generally taste like crap.  Not this one!  It contains Stevia which is a plant that is naturally sweet but calorie free, no diabetic impact, etc etc.  It also uses Erythritol for sweetness which is a sugar alcohol.  I like the taste, it doesn't rot my teeth, and it doesn't make me sluggish or fat.  The one downside is the price.  Economies of scale rule the beverage business, and Zevia is a small player.  The product benefits offset the price in my mind and using Amazon Subscribe & Save offsets some of the cost.  That is certainly the cheapest way to get Zevia.

review/summary: Not as Good as Cola or Root Beer Flavors
review/text: This is the first Zevia flavor I got to try.  I didn't really want it but it was all Amazon had in stock and ready to ship for Prime members (more on that later).  I was so eager to try it I popped a can open right when I got it in the house.  My initial thought was that it was gross but I thought I could get used to it by the time I get through the entire case.  My wife tried it at room temperature and she hated it.  She didn't touch anymore orange or the black cherry I got later because of that first taste.  She's since had some nice cold root beer and cola Zevia which she was impressed with.  My nearly three year old son also had a taste test of the orange flavor.  He's not a soda drinker so maybe that had something to do with his reaction.  He drank about an 1/8 of a can which surprisingly all came back up on my kitchen floor about two minutes after he drank it.  He said he didn't like it.  Ha.  Out of the four flavors of Zevia, orange is my least favorite.  I will not be ordering it again due in part to its taste, which I would say is okay, but also the price for it.  I am willing to pay the price for now for a couple of the other flavors, but not orange.<br /><br />There are two major problems with ordering Zevia products.  First, they're expensive.  At just over a dollar a can they are pricey, no other way to describe it.  The second, is availability.  Amazon is really having some issues with keeping Zevia flavors in stock with Prime shipping.  The third party sellers all have exuberant shipping prices bringing your case of soda to over fifty dollars.  I've emailed Zevia about this and did get a response from them.  I hope Amazon can keep it stocked and Zevia can keep them supplied.  It's a good product but it's been frustrating trying to order due to Amazon's stock.  Due to the high price tag I put it on a monthly schedule to save 15%.  It helps but I wonder if Amazon will have it ready to go each month.<br /><br />The Zevia Orange is an okay tasting soda.  I will not be purchasing any more of it even if it's all Amazon Prime has in stock.

review/text: Good Product and shipped in a timely manner.  I tried to make another order through Amazon with the coupon but it would not accept the coupon code.  So I won't order again until i figure it out.  If anyone can advise on what to do.  I tried calling Zevia but could not get through to any human so I gave up.

review/summary: Pretty Darn good
review/text: For someone trying to stay low on the glycemic index, this stuff is great.  Stevia doesn't cause insulin reactions, blood sugar spikes, etc.  The Lime wasn't too tasty in my opinion.  The orange is pretty good.  I do wish it was just a little more "orangee" in the flavor department.

review/summary: Good Stuff! Not Overly Sweet!!
review/text: OK,..I'm speaking on behalf of the Orange Soda here. When I first popped the tab and drank a sip of the Zevia Orange,..it did NOT hit me with the anticipated sweetness that I had come to expect from say a Diet Sunkist Soda or any of your typical SugarFree Orange sodas. I wasn't disappointed per say, but just surprised a bit by the unexpected lack of sweetness.<br /><br />Now, with that being said,...and a few cans later,..this has quickly become my "go to" drink when I want a refreshing orange soda. It is very good and very quenching (due to the noticeable lack of sodium) on a hot summer day. The aroma is wonderful and the flavor is very close to as real as you can get before drinking straight orange oil. It's a really good soda and I'm now tempted to try the Root Beer and the Cola.

review/text: Hello to all those Moms out there looking for something to hand to your kids that won't make them over-weight, rot their teeth out and make them try and climb the walls!  You need Zevia Natural Orange.  All kids LOVE soda pop, you can't fight it.  I have tried for over 9 years. This is why I am so pleased to have found Zevia Orange.  It has no calories and it's all natural, even the bright orange color.  As a Mom, I feel great about being able to buy soda pop for my son.

review/summary: Better than Sunkist and Orangina!
review/text: Ever since I learned about the dangers of sugar and chemical sugars, I have avoided them like the plague.  Then when I accidentally discovered an online ad for a "stevia-sweetened" soft drink named Zevia, well, let's just say I was hooked.<br /><br />Zevia is an alternative to diet soda that is sweetened with my two favorite sweeteners: erythritol and stevia. Wow! There is no calcium-removing phosphoric acid like you'd find in regular toxic sodas. And the taste is great! I've only tried the Orange and Natural Twist flavors with Orange being my favorite so far. I hear they came out with a new root beer flavor so that makes a total of four different Zevia sodas to choose from.<br /><br />Diabetics and those with Candida will welcome this new alternative to soda. I know me and my father sure did. Can't wait to open a nice cold one right after I write this review. Ahhhhhh!

I think it tastes just like baby aspirin. This one will be going down the drain. I also bought a lemon/ lime one... we'll see. But for now- bleah! BTW, the added erythritol would account for one reviewers "unpleasant lower gastric effects".

review/text: HEED THE REVIEWS.<br /><br />This thing is TINY. Like... ridiculously small. My husband got this for me for Mother's Day. It came in the regular old amazon box. I opened the box and there was this tiny little thing inside, shrink wrapped and pathetic looking. Someone in the reviews said it "was an embarrassment" to give. That about sums it up. I didn't think it was possible to feel worse about my miscarriage, but then this pathetic thing arrived on my doorstep. Not only that, but it was delivered over a week late (we opted for 2 day shipping). The description doesn't bother to mention anything about the contents, so allow me: 15 small chocolate items. Small, small, small. There were 3 regular sized chocolate bars and the rest were miniatures.<br /><br />They sell those mini Ghirardelli squares for 50 cents at convenience stores. Yet somehow 4 of those, 3 chocolate bars, and some other miscellaneous minis stuffed haphazardly in a cheap, crappy basket and shrink wrapped in a shipping facility cost $40??<br /><br />I don't know how else to phrase it, this thing sucks.<br /><br />We learned our lesson with this "gift basket" stuff- BUY IN PERSON (same goes for flower arrangements).

review/summary: These are fantastic
review/text: As someone who has trouble with products containing gluten, I was thrilled to find these crackers.  I was concerned that they might be too hard, since the box says "baked with rough oatmeal, for a coarse oaty texture".  If I had to describe them, I'd say mealy.  Unlike a lot of gluten free products, these didn't come broken.  They are delicious, and very filling.  I had two as a snack, and then couldn't eat lunch for awhile!  I had mine with peanut butter, but they'd be fabulously addictive with cheese or Cheez Whiz.  We're all about Cheez Whiz at my house and buy it in bulk.  Give these little charmers a try, and you won't want to be without them. Millions of Scotsmen can't be wrong, and neither can I!

review/summary: Great Extract with Lovely Lemon Flavor
review/text: I was hesitant to buy a larger bottle at first because I had read some reviews regarding a clear bottle and a decrease in quality from OliveNation, so I bought the smallest container to try it out. I encourage you to ignore the previous review about there being alcohol in the extract: all extracts are suspended in alcohol- normally an pure fruit oil and alcohol mixture.<br /><br />Anyways, the extracts were well packaged and shipped quickly. I was pleased to find that the 4 oz container is tinted glass and the aroma is superb. I have used the extract in various baked goods and it provides a lovely hint of lemon.<br /><br />The only con about this item is that it is very subtle. I need to add what seems to me to be a lot of extract to get the dominate lemon flavor in things like lemon poppy seed muffins.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who is in short supply of fresh lemon juice. This makes an excellent substitution.

I use these in recipes that call for regular saltines and it just gives the recipes that extra "punch" that they would not otherwise have.  The butter in them just adds an extra moistness but they're also awesome as a dip cracker.  Plus, they add a little extra flavor when crushed up into soups.  They do have a tendency to get stale quicker than others though but I guess that's why they make Ziploc bags! Highly recommend!

Originally starting out as a gag gift because I didn't really think about quite how big 54 ounces really is! For the amount of money I paid for this, these Skittles will last him a good month or two (he even went out and bought a motion sensored candy dispensor at CVS for them). It's just great for the money you pay for all of those Skittles!

review/summary: Slightly variations from the Mint Flavor
review/text: I tried several different flavors of Mentos gum, but was rather disappointed by the overall product.<br /><br />First of all, the good points. The gum comes in a hard, durable container, which is easy to carry around in one's pants pocket, and also facilitates dispensing. Additionally, I like the initial texture of the gum, as it has a hard exterior shell and a soft chewy interior core, which immediately releases a burst of flavoring. Lastly, the texture and consistency of the gum is maintained throughout the mastication process.<br /><br />Now, the bad part. The biggest drawback is that the flavor only lasts at most a few minutes, necessitating me to eat several pieces at once in order to maintain any semblance of lasting mint flavor. Compared to other rival brands such as Dentyne or Eclipse, this is unacceptable. I'm not interested in chewing a piece of bland plastic after just 2-3 minutes. Some have also commented that the hard container makes too much noise in one's pants pockets when walking around.<br /><br />In summary, the Mentos are best used as an ephemeral breath mint, rather than a long-lasting gum.<br /><br />Now in regards to this particular flavor of red fruit lime, I find that the flavor lasts slightly longer as compared to the mint flavor.  Still not long enough, but just a smidgeon longer.  Additionally, the packaging is deceptive, because the core of the gum is most certainly not green colored.

review/text: These suckers (sorry for the pun) are getting hard to find, so I appreciate what I can get.  Mom and I both agree these are a bit less salty tasting than most we've encountered over the last 50 years.  Besides a bit saltier taste, I would prefer if these Salmiak Pastillen were firmer/harder. Unfortunately, I don't have the willpower to open them and let them sit around long enough for that to happen :-)  Overall, I'm glad I bought their last 11 bags.

review/summary: Oh Danny boy...the matcha, the matcha is calllling....
review/text: Irish cream teas tend to make me sad. What I've found is that they tend to taste like regular tea with a hint of Irish cream in the background, like you had poured a drop or two into your tea. Which is all well and good, but I drank Irish cream straight up when I was in college, and I want something that tastes like the drink itself. At this point, you're probably wondering if I did anything but drink in college. The answer is....no, not really. Ha! I want an Irish cream tea that I can splash into other teas to make them taste like Irish cream.<br /><br />So I cheated a little with this one. Just a little, I promise! I mixed my spoon of matcha with a few drops of my Irish cream agave before adding the water. I was blown away. It was so, so, so good. It got me through an incredibly long day at work and it kept a smile on my face long after it was gone. It smelled and tasted so strongly of Irish cream that my boss side eyed me a few times until I showed him it was just matcha. And then he was jealous.<br /><br />I love this tea. With the milk allergy issues, Irish cream was one of the things I had to give up and it was with a heavy heart that I did so. This is one of those teas I've been searching and searching for and once again, Red Leaf Tea did it right. I am constantly impressed by them...you'd think by now, I'd just expect their matcha to be amazing. But no, every time I get a new package, I'm floored by the tastiness.

review/summary: Creamy Boozy Delight
review/text: I got this one special for my boyfriend as a surprise. Last time he got to pick out a matcha, we ended up with Cola, so this time I thought an alcoholic drink matcha was in order. More sophisticated? Well - more adult anyways ;)<br /><br />He is loving the flavoured matcha as much (if not more!) than I do! This one smelled sweet from the get go - creamy and .. tangy? Smoky? Not smoky! I'm trying to describe what irish cream smells like - it doesn't have the smokiness of whisky - but it definitely is sweet and creamy! I knew it was going to be a real treat - just like the real thing!<br /><br /> What a neat flavour experience! I prepared the matcha straight and thick for the first bowl. In this state I tasted mostly matcha with an aftertaste of sweet cream that lingered after finishing the bowl. It was very creamy and pleasant.<br /><br />Next I tried it over ice with 18% cream and sugar. I thought my eyes were going to roll into the back of my head and be lost forever! This was mine and Mike's favourite way to enjoy it. It's sweet, but because you have control over the amount of sugar, it's not crazy sweet and cloying. You could probably enjoy cup after cup with the only buzz coming from the energy of all that matcha you're drinking!<br /><br />This one is so so good mixed with the Madagascar Vanilla matcha - it just adds a bit of something that takes the creamy flavour over the top. Come St. Patricks day, it would be an awesome drink to mix with mint matcha (Mint is on the way in the mail as we speak!) and hey - it's already green! No need to add any food colouring for your Paddy experience ;)<br /><br />Now - if a Guinness Matcha ever comes out - I know the perfect one to mix it with ;)

review/summary: MSG  and 10% Water-Salt- SodiumPhospate... yum?
review/text: I'm experimenting with various Campbell soups because I'm on diet.  And from a diet point-of-view the Beefy Mushroom soup is not bad.  A whole can made up with water is only 125 calories.<br /><br />However, that said, I shan't be buying it again.  First off, too thin and watery.  There is less than 1/4 cup of anything solid, ie, mushrooms or beef cubes.<br /><br />Another minus is the MSG (monosodium glutamate).<br />Another minus is the 890 mg of sodium.  Yikes!  But what can you expect when 10% of this product is described as "Water, Salt, and Sodium Phospate.<br /><br />Other unsavory ingredients include Hydrolyzed Yeast Protein and Extract, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, and Hydrolyzed Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />Not another can for my family or myself.  It's not healthy and it left me with a funny aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />Going to brush now...<br />Pam T~

review/summary: Campbell's Beefy Mushroom Soup Is Still Made
review/text: I'm another one of those people who have looked for years, without success, to find Campbell's Beefy Mushroom Soup on the grocery store shelves.  But, by searching on the internet recently, I came across the soup for sale on Amazon.  Others, as well as myself, have wondered if the product was fresh stock since it's very hard to find.  Well, I recently called Campbell's to inquire if the soup was still in production, and they assured me it was.  So, last fall, I ordered 2 cases of the soup on Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H136JY">Campbell's Beefy Mushroom, 10.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> and the expiration was in 2011 or 2012 (I forget).  I've already used up all the soup and I'm ready to order more.  When this soup first appeared in grocery stores years ago, the label had this YUMMY recipe on it, which I have used ever since.  It is my husband's favorite hamburger dish.  This recipe transforms ordinary hamburger into a delicious comfort food your family is sure to love.  It's so easy to make, but ohhh sooo good!  Here it is:<br /><br />"Campbell's Salisbury Steak"<br /><br />1 (10 3/4 ounce) can Campbell's Beefy Mushroom Soup<br />1 1/2 lbs ground beef<br />1 egg, lightly beaten<br />1/2 c. fine dry breadcrumbs<br />1/4 c. finely chopped onion<br />1/8 t. pepper<br />1/4 c. water<br /><br />1) Add 1/4 c. soup, egg, breadcrumbs, onion and pepper to the ground beef and mix well.<br />2) Shape into 6 patties.<br />3) Brown both sides in ungreased skillet, over medium heat; not cooking them completely.<br />4) Drain off the fat.<br />5) Spoon over the patties the undiluted Beefy-Mushroom soup and 1/4 c. water.<br />6) Cover the skillet and simmer over low heat 20 minutes or until done, spooning the gravy over the patties occasionally.<br />7) Delicious served with mashed potatoes, cooked green beans and rolls with butter.<br /><br />Serves 6

review/summary: Great by itself or in cooking
review/text: I haven't been able to find this in my local grocery stores so have stocked up through amazon. I sometimes have this soup on its own but I especially like it with pasta and it's a cinch to make. My favorite easy-easy-easy recipe is to take a can of the soup, add 1/4 to 1/2 a can of water (optional -- as "sauce" it's thicker without the water of course), cook it on the stovetop, pour half of it over cooked pasta or egg noodles (the standard 2 oz. UNCOOKED weight per serving), and mix well. Put in a medium square Ziploc container, snap on the lid, and freeze. (So the way I do it, I get 2 servings per can of soup.)  I usually have several of these in my freezer so if I am lazy I just grab one to take to work with me -- it heats up in the microwave in 2-3 minutes.  It makes a pretty filling lunch that is low in calories, very low in fat (maybe 2 or 3 grams per serving including the egg noodles), and quite tasty!  (Yeah, no veggies, so have a salad with it, :-) .)  You can get more recipes at Campbell's web site or elsewhere online -- I am always experimenting with their soups, and amazon makes it easy to stock up on them and try lots of different things.

review/summary: BACK by popular demand
review/text: While not yet back in the stores, some company has heard the voice of the customer and responded.  It has now been in production for a few weeks and supposedly coming soon to a store near you with no need to settle for old product @ $2 or $3 a can bought from scalpers.  This is one I have been demanding since it was discontinued.  Now if I could just get Kraft to start making yellow mustard again, Heinz to start making Cajun BBQ sauce again, and about 50 other products that are apparently no longer pulling in enough to make it worthwhile in today's shave every penny from every inch of shelf space world, things wouldn't seem quite as bad.  It is these little seemingly insignificant things (when they are around every day) that add to the ability to cope in an ever stressed out environment.  Too philosophic for a missing can of soup and bottle of mustard?  Priorities all messed up?  Remember NEW COKE!  Better yet, remember when you got a wooden case of Coke delivered to your door in 5 minutes (you have to be over 45 for this one) if you called and said you just drank a flat or funny tasting Coke?  To you younger folks, this is TRUE!  Guys on trucks drove all over the city with cases of Coke to deliver to anyone who had a complaint.  That was customer service.  Give me the late 50's and early 60's WITHOUT RACISM anytime.  We can find a way to get there.  Demand the Bureauracracies give us our lives back.  We don't need them.

review/summary: Amazing Product!
review/text: Like most Amercians, curry was a mystery to me, aside from the reputation for 5 alarm heat! I looked up the definition of curry & found it to be a very complex product of many, many exotic & sometimes obscure spices. A co-worker gave my husband a box of this product after an especially good potluck.<br /><br />This product lends a deliciously rich and complex flavor. You control the heat by deciding how much you want to use. I made a curry vegetable stew with cashews and garbanzo beans and then used a small piece of this product to add flavor. I then added a cup of Greek Yogurt to add some character to it. Wow! Delicious and hearty. My husband loved it. And somehow the curry spices neutralized the gassy potential of the chickpeas. I added a little extra curry to my bowl to bring the flavors up to my liking, as my husband won't eat anything with detectable pepper heat. I plan to order the "Mild" when my current box is gone.<br /><br />This product is wonderful, convenient & highly recommended. AND the shelf-life is phenomenal. I know this because I cooked with it recently, only to discover afterwards it was YEARS beyond the "Best Used Before" date. It had no rancidity & was so good I would've never known if I hadn't looked at the box.

review/text: This is the. best. Japanese. curry. EVER.  Period!  Growing up, I lived with my family in Japan for eight years and curry was a family favorite (even for two very, very picky little boys).  When we moved back my mom was able to find this at the local Asian market - and years later, when I moved out and had to cook on my own, I found it on Amazon.  HURRAY!  This is a staple in our house, especially during the winter.  It is now a family favorite for MY family - husband, and kids aged 6, 5, and 2.  It is SUPER simple to make (trust me when I say this!  I am not much of a cook!).  Just add chicken and veggies to the pot!  I do alter the recipe a bit but adding only 1 onion and more carrots, but that's just our personal prefernce.  Half a package will feed my family of 5, with leftovers.<br /><br />This curry also comes in mild and hot.  Hot is too spicy for my kiddos and mild is too mild for my husband.  But they are all good.  Try it - I PROMISE you will love it!  I would give it 10 stars if I could!!

review/summary: a family favorite for twenty years
review/text: I married into the Japanese culture and a whole new world of cuisine was opened up to me. I didn't know that curry is actually a staple dish in many Japanese households, nor that sauce mixes like this are a very "traditional" way of making curry, meaning it's one thing that home cooks don't usually make from scratch. This brand is the favorite and most popular from what I was told by my in-laws and I can see why.<br /><br />It comes formed sort of like a chocolate bar with break points in it that you can snap off as much as you need. The flavor is warm and not to spicy; I prefer mild but my family likes it a little hot and this was not too spicy for me. We usually add beef cubes, potatoes, onions and carrots and serve over Japanese/sticky rice and it makes a fantastic supper.<br /><br />Very pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/summary: Rooibos Tea and Spices.
review/text: Rooibos is Afrikaans for "red bush." Grown in South Africa's Cederburg Mountains and harvested during the summer, this tea acquires its unique red color as a result of fermentation (in mounds) and oxidization, when it is spread out to dry in the sunlight; naturally it is green.<br /><br />Rooibos is known for its health benefits stemming from its rich content in vitamins, antioxidants, flavanoids and minerals (inter alia, magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, zinc, potassium, fluoride, manganese and alpha-hydroxy) and has a long tradition of medicinal use among the local Native population; among other things, it is known to help cure asthma, hay fever and other allergies, acne, eczema, colics, indigestion, insomnia, and nervous tension. Containing very few tannins and no caffeine, rooibos has a distinctive aroma and amber color.<br /><br />This tea blends well with various spices and condiments; my favorite mixture is a delicious loose leaf blend sold by my local tea store, which features orange peel, cinnamon, grated coconut, finely minced chili and red pepper. For a more commercial alternative, though, Tazo's Red Bush tea is a great choice as well: a rich, exquisite blend of rooibos, hibiscus, orange peel, rosemary, several lemon ingredients (lemon myrtle, verbena and balm), as well as a number of sweet spices. Enjoy!

review/summary: Trickery
review/text: The product I ordered and received is what was advertised.  BUT, I think there is a bit of trickery going on since the can was half the size of a NORMAL can of cat food.  Of course, it's my fault for not checking the oz. in a normal can but, most people have never heard of a small can size of cat food.

review/summary: YUCK
review/text: This stuff is just AWFUL!<br /><br />One star is one star too many.<br /><br />The only thing raspberry about it is the color.<br /><br />I'm with one of the other reviewers - 5.95 bottles straight to the dump.  This is the first review I have ever written, but it needed doing.<br /><br />I think the person who gave Pappy's five stars might be  called Mammy ----<br /><br />Incidentally, the pomegranate syrup Amazon sells is good stuff.  It's a bit sour, so I mix it with something sweeter, fill the glass with ice and soda water and have it with lunch.

review/text: I tried this product only because another brand (Oak Hill Farms raspberry tea concentrate) was no longer available on Amazon.  I regretted it after one sip:  the tea was very bitter and had no noticeable raspberry flavor.  The taste might be salvaged by a great deal of sweetener, but Oak Hill Farms required none.

review/summary: Soft Drinks Made With Cane Sugar for My Guests.
review/text: Some time ago (September, 2009) I wrote a review for Mexican Coke. It came in 12-ounce bottles in a 24-bottle case. The bottles resembled the old fashioned Coke bottles. The main distinction between Mexican Coke and that manufacture in the USA was that Mexican coke was made with cane sugar whereas American Coke was made with high fructose corn syrup. Some people worry about possible health effects of HFCS and others simply don't like the taste as well. Personally, I think the Mexican Coike tastes a bit better. Gormet Coca Cola? Well, whatever, Mexican Coke has now become a big favorite and you can find it all over, even in restaurents.<br /><br />Now, on my last trip to my local Costco store, I found a 12-bottle case of "Vintage Soda," a variety of past-famous American soda beverages. There's Dad's Root Beer, Bubble Up, Nesbitt's Orange Soda and NuGrape Soda. All are made with cane sugar. They're quite good, but I have no standard bottles for comparison. Also, I only rarely drink sodas. I have a supply at home, but it's mainly for guests. Some guests want diet drinks and some don't care for diet sodas. so for the sweetend ones, I use the cane sugar varieties.They get good reviews and it makes for an interesting conversation piece.<br /><br /> Gary Peterson

review/text: We've tried every brand (DeBoles, Tinkyada, etc.) and the Quinoa pasta is the easiest to cook.  Add a bunch of oil to the pasta water, bring to a boil, and pour in the pasta *while stirring*.  Bring to a new boil, turn down to a simmer, and cook for 6-7 minutes (depends on heat--test after 4 minutes).  Drain and if you overcooked it, rinsed under COLD water--sometimes you can save GF pasta by doing this.  The quinoa pasta is high in protein and an excellent GF pasta.

review/summary: Read the fine print on the box of QUINOA Ancient Harvest Supergrain Pasta
review/text: While this pasta tastes better than many whole grain pastas, I am giving a ranking of 2 because although the packaging strongly suggests this product contains a significant amount of quinoa, the actual amount of quinoa in the corn-quinoa blend may be just slightly greater than the amount of dried spinach needed to color a few of the pieces green. So don't have your decision swayed by the side or back panels, which detail the wonderful nutritional profile of quinoa and its history of cultivation. Note that the company's website states "our Corn/Quinoa gluten free pasta is primarily a corn based product." So maybe they should be putting the word "corn" in the big print?

review/summary: Falls apart, leaving a gritty mess
review/text: I really like the other Ancient Harvest GF pastas.  I tried two boxes of this and varied cooking times, sauces, and experimented with a few other variables.  Without fail, anytime I had to re-heat the pasta, it fell apart when I stirred it.  I am the only person in the house who has to be GF so I am usually the only one eating the pasta.  It is kind of a pain to make a single serving of my pasta and a pot full for everyone else.  I like being able to make a few serving to refrigerate and have something for lunch the next day, but the way this pasta just crumbles creates a texture I can't stand.  It's tiny pasta pieces and sauce, which I haven't had with the other pastas.  It's also the only brand that I had trouble finding a good cooking time.  The box says 4 to 6 minutes, but that always left hard pasta, even when dropped in salted water that was at a rolling boil.  I would check minute by minute and it seemed to be different every time, and sometimes it seemed like only half the noodles were cooked well and the others were too hard or over-cooked.  I'm a decent cook and don't have that issue with the other AH pastas, GF pastas, or the wheat pastas I cook for the rest of the family.  I will skip the shapes and stick to the other pastas made by Ancient Harvest.

You can't just dump the box into boiling water and dump it into a strainer when the time's up; the pasta will stick together, and if you overcook, it's going to dissolve and turn gluey. But if you have even marginally passable cooking skillz, this stuff is really good and very far from nasty.

review/summary: Perfect Texture and Flavor!
review/text: I have cooked this pasta several times and had no trouble with it at all. I have no gluten intolerance, so my use of this pasta started out as experimental, and my continued use is simply based on taste and texture.  I wonder if the negative reviews of this pasta came from people who don't otherwise prepare pasta correctly. I have had no trouble with it, as it cooks like traditional pasta. Generously salt the water, bring to boil and add pasta. Allow the water to return to a boil and continue to cook on full heat until the pasta is done.<br /><br />It's important to note, I suppose, that cooking time varies among all stoves regardless of whether or not the pasta is semolina based or gluten free. How much heat a pot of boiling water receives is going to affect cooking time. As for any pasta, the time on the box should be used only as a guideline to give you an idea of when to check your pasta. Pasta water must be salted, and the pasta occasionally stirred.<br /><br />This pasta may come out too hard if it's not been cooked long enough, I guess. Too soft means it was cooked for too long, (and perhaps that the pasta water was not salted), which is why you taste the pasta before dumping the pot into a strainer. Again, this is true for all pasta, so my guess is people who had a problem cooking this pasta were probably interpreting the cooking time too literally and not sampling a piece before straining. In my kitchen, all pasta colors cooked evenly.<br /><br />When the pasta is cooked correctly:<br /><br />the pasta texture is excellent and very comparable to traditional semolina pasta. In fact, regarding texture specifically, there is little discernible difference at all. My family of regular pasta eaters could not discern between this and regular pasta. I served it with marinara sauce which probably masked the subtle flavor difference. This pasta is made from corn and has subtle notes of corn to it, the way a spinach pasta has notes of spinach: it still tastes like pasta. These are mostly detectable when the pasta is eaten completely plain, but hardly when the pasta is sauced at all. In fact, the notes of corn actually work really well with certain dishes and I would certainly choose this pasta for certain dishes for that very reason.

Nutritionally there is little difference as the Ancient Harvest pastas are mostly corn flour (as is Leeper's).

review/text: I have never tried gluten-free pasta before but am doing a cleanse that doesn't allow gluten. I bought this from Whole Foods after seeing that, out of all the gluten free pasta's available, this one only had 1 left on the shelf. I figured if other people were buying it up, it had to be good. I had to cook it for about 18 minutes in boiling water with a little salt and oil, but the pasta came out great. The texture was dense and the flavors of the bell pepper came through in the orange pieces. I am extremely happy with it and will be purchasing it again.

I ate the whole bag in one night because they were so dang good. Don't be fooled into believing that all your getting are mushrooms; you also get the neat bag in which they are delivered in. Your friends will be so jealous when they see you strutting your stuff with a bag that can easily serve all of your fungus needs (up to 15 lbs!).<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend that anyone buy these mushrooms, and I would do the same again if I didn't use my life's savings on them.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: I've tried quite a few different brands of this type of microwave meal that doesn't need freezing or refrigeration, and most of them are not very good. What they lack in flavor, they make up for in high fat, salt, or other junk I'd rather avoid. They also have a tendency to taste like plastic.<br /><br />This Barilla Penne and Marinara were pleasantly surprising. The sauce smells a bit more like basil than I usually like, but tastes great, with a good combination of fresh tomato and spices. The pasta was perfectly al-dente. Actually, it was much better than expensive frozen dinners have been able to produce.<br /><br />Adding a little fresh parmesan, this was a tasty and filling lunch.<br /><br />The only downside is in the packaging, which seems overly substantial. The tray and inner sauce holder are both made of very heavy plastic, which seems like a waste. Fortunately, they are recyclable.

review/text: Barilla's Penne Traditional is a very tasty microwaveable meal with plenty of pasta.  The sauce compares well with some Italian restaurants - chunky bits of tomato, smooth tomato taste and nice firm pasta.  It cooks up really fast.  Once cooked, the sauce needs to be mixed with the pasta and that can be tricky if not paying attention.  The tray with the sauce needs to be carefully lifted off the main container and poured on the pasta.  Not a big problem but has the potential to spill.<br /><br />Otherwise, mix and enjoy.  Barilla also makes a spicier version of this pasta containing basil - not bad either but I prefer this one.

review/text: I tried another variety of these Barilla mezze penne dishes, so my observations on the basic product and its packaging are in that other review, with a good impression overall. I found the packaging to be user-friendly and love the fact that these meals have all-natural ingredients.<br /><br />I thought that the taste of this mezze penne meal with the traditional marinara sauce was just like the other one I tried, with the real difference being that the other one had whole wheat pasta. I don't know that I really distinguished any difference between the two, having them for lunch on two consecutive days, but I did enjoy both.<br /><br />In this one I noticed the chunks of tomato and onions. The sauce was thick enough for the pasta, yet it still poured easily from the separate container upon coming out of the microwave.<br /><br />I like that you don't have to add water to these dishes before microwaving; the pasta is already cooked and just has to be heated.<br /><br />Overall, my impression of this product was very good.

review/summary: Not the worst thing I ever tasted.
review/text: Okay, this is not your sweet nonni's special Sunday sauce, and the penne aren't her own hand cut and rolled individually around the handle of her wood spoon little pastas that you grew up with (and if the food was that good, why the heck did you leave home?  Ask yourself!).  But it won't kill you.  And if you are up to here with tunafish sandwiches, on a budget, in a hurry, and trapped inside because Life As We Know It has come to a disasterous end, it's not a bad lunch.  It's not good, but there are worse things, and we've all probably tasted them. Canned spaghetti, for one thing. Or canned chicken noodle soup, lord help us and the poor chicken that died in vain for that stuff.<br /><br />If you are used to those bottled supermarket sauces, you might find this completely acceptable.  It is mostly salty and slightly tomato-ey.  The sauce is a tiny bit on the bitter side, probably from dehydrated garlic. It has that metallic aftertaste. But you can taste the basil, there are little red chunks that could indeed be tomato, and the texture of the pasta is not as bad as it might be. It has a sort of gummy/pastiness, but not that slimy tongue-feel of canned soup noodles.<br /><br />You have to cook it a bit longer than the instructions state, especially if you have an underpowered microwave.  The portion size is decent, but it's not exactly low cal, packing about 350 calories. If you add a salad and a beverage, you're looking at 500 to 600 calories easy, and you could have had a Big Mac or a ham and cheese sandwich or something really really good instead.<br /><br />If you work in an office where people steal food, offer the crooks a taste. This stuff is not so good that they'll be tempted to "borrow" a box when you're not looking.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this if I were a survivalist. A good change from the  canned beefaroni. I might buy this to keep on hand at work for emergencies...days when I forgot to bring something from home or going out for real food was not possible, and every restaurant in town suddenly stopped delivering. I would not buy them as an altenative or replacement for the real thing.  And the real thing is so easy to make...and takes no time at all.  Boil pasta according to package directions. Put a little olive oil in a frying pan, throw in some finely chopped garlic. Let it saute on low heat...but don't let it brown. Cut a pint of cherry tomatoes in half and toss them in. Add a pinch of sugar and a pinch of red peper flakes or some cayenne or chili powder. Diced chile peppers are even better, as many as you like for as hot as you like.  Cook for ten minutes. Drain the pasta, toss it into the frying pan and swirl it around so it gets all mixed up with the tomatoes and garlicky oil. Add some shredded basil.  You can throw in some diced mozzarela, sprinkle on parmesan or asiago or whatever Italian grated cheese you like.  20 minutes, start to finish, and you have something really nice. With crusty bread, a tart green salad and some wine, it's a feast. Buy some supermarket lemon sorbet and tart it up with grated lemon peel and some mint leaves and you are a chef.

review/text: I was impressed with this meal, I couldn't imagine the quality Barilla is known for being seriously ready for consumption in sixty seconds. What I love most about it was the fact that it had real sauce that is comperable to what you would put on your homemade pasta. Most meals like this taste more like an upgraded cup of noodles, where this is a nice meal in a crunch. Now I will say you really need to read the instructions before cooking. The opening instructions can be assumed and cause the sauce to go flying when the food is done cooking. With that in mind, it's not ideal for kids to cook on their own. The film was rather tight and I can see a child or pre-teen getting burned if they are not paying attention while the open the contents. With that, please be careful. Outside of that, it was delicious for a microwave meal.

The traditional marinara sauce was quite good, but I prefer the spicy marinara sauce. It was a little hard to pull the cover off, and the sauce, since it was in a separate little container, did splatter a bit.  The meal consists of 320 calories and includes 6g of fiber.  For a 60-second meal, it is very tasty.  Just add a salad and slice of french bread - and this makes for a super quick meal.

review/summary: Just Ok, but a Brilliant Idea!
review/text: Barilla's new pantry Mezze Penne products are an exciting lineup.  You can enjoy a hot pasta meal in 60 seconds.  Furthermore, the product stores at room temperature, which allows you to take it to work to use in a work microwave, or to have it shipped from a store like Amazon.com without worry in most climates.  This product includes the Traditional Marinara Sauce.<br /><br />The pasta sauce is stored in a bin above the pasta.  To prepare the meal, you peal back the top seal to expose the sauce and allow ventilation.  You heat it for 60 seconds.  Let it cool, remove the rest of the seal carefully, pour the sauce on the pasta, transfer it to a plate should you wish, and eat!  It's fast, and it is simple.  No refrigeration required.  It truly is a nifty idea.<br /><br />The only downside is that they are not the tastiest products.  I have tried the Tomato & Basic, Marina, and Spicy Marina.  It's extremely difficult for me to tell a difference between any of the sauces.  The sauces are not great.  Just ok.  My favorite is probably the Spicy Marina, but it's truly stretching it to call one my favorite and again, to even differentiate the taste between sauces is difficult.<br /><br />In terms of the pasta, it comes out slightly gooey and not as soft as it could be.  Just ok.  There are some additional instructions provided, to add some water to the pasta after the first 60 seconds and cook longer, but these instructions are not completely clear.  I tried this once, and the pasta did not change at all.<br /><br />Overall, a brilliant idea.  With the great storage ability, it's not bad to have one or two of these on hand for a long work day, when you want a simple lunch or dinner fast.  However, in general, I would not want to consume these on a daily basis.  Perhaps, over time, they will improve the product.  If they could include just a slightly higher quality sauce and pasta, it could be a real winner.  Right now, just ok.

review/summary: Very tasty!
review/text: This pasta was very good! I was a bit skeptical at first about the pre-cooked pasta in a container that did not need to be refrigerated, but I ate it and had no ill side effects :)<br /><br />The instructions to heat up the pasta and sauce were simple and because it's not a frozen meal, it only took about 1:30 in the microwave. The pasta was cooked well. The sauce, while simple marinara, was really good. Just enough seasoning to make it taste good without taking away from the great tomato taste. The marinara was also chunky and not pureed or watery or runny.<br /><br />Overall a very good product that I would eat again.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good
review/text: This Barilla brand meal comes in a microwavable dish and needs no refrigeration or freezing. I have tried other brands and they do not compare too this in taste. Plus the other brands I have tried all required the addition of water too the noodles before microwaving and this does not. Easy too store and cook!<br /><br />The Penne with Marinara Sauce is microwaved in its container for only sixty seconds and the pasta came out just fine. The marinara sauce was flavorful and when mixed made for a fast and delicious meal. I found it enjoyable and as I can no longer lift boiling water this is an excellent alternative. Not as good as home made but much better than canned pasta and other brands of microwavable meals I have tried. I would get this again.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I am a professor and associate dean at a local college, so my days are typically long and I rarely have time to make or buy food. Usually, I will grab a frozen meal to throw in the microwave at work. But this is not ideal because...well...we all know the good and bad of frozen meals. So when I saw that there was another option, I became extremely excited! I grabbed one of these meals and brought it to work. It is perfect! There are specific instructions on how long to microwave and what to microwave. When you follow the instructions, it is a really good meal! I won't say that it tastes exactly like when I make pasta at home, but it's definitely a better option than your typical frozen meals.

review/summary: Tastes FRESH and it is actually filling
review/text: This product is hands down one of the BEST shelf stable meals on the market. It is easy to prepare but I do caution to pay close attention to the packaging as the sauce is separate from the pasta and you don't want to splash your clothing when you take the plastic film off after cooking so hold the bowl firmly.  The sauce is rich and has chunks of fresh tasting tomatoes,basil, oregano and other spices that you can SEE and more importantly taste! The pasta is cooked but firm and it holds up well to the rich sauce. There are NO preservatives which makes it even more remarkable for being so flavorful. I would highly recommend these for a quick lunch or to use as a mid afternoon snack if you are having a late dinner. I want to try all the varieties!

review/summary: Mediocre but passable in a pinch
review/text: I can't say that I recommend the Barilla Mezze Penne with Traditional Marinara Sauce but neither can I pan it. Let me start off by saying that I do not usually eat microwaveable meals (i.e., soups, canned pastas, frozen dinners, etc.), not because I have anything against them, but because I can't find any that I like. So, I was very much looking forward to trying this simple pasta dish with marinara sauce, hoping I might finally find a quick, easy meal that I like. I was skeptical that the pasta would come out firm enough for my liking and was pleasantly surprised that the pasta was a fairly decent firm texture to it when cooked according to the regular cooking instructions. (There are additional instructions for those who prefer their pasta softer.) While the texture was good, the flavor was not so great. The sauce tasted OK but the pasta itself had a slightly "off" flavor to it that would push past the sauce flavor if you didn't put enough sauce on it. If you scooped up enough sauce with it, I found it to be OK (not good, but OK). My teenage daughter also tried it and she did not notice an "off" taste to the pasta but did find the sauce to be a little to "tangy" after eating about half of the portion.<br /><br />Preparation was easy. You peel back a small corner of the plastic and microwave for 1 minute. That's it. I did have a little trouble removing the plastic cover once it was cooked. I really had to finesse it carefully so as to avoid spilling the sauce all over the place, but other than that, it couldn't have been easier.<br /><br />All in all, this pasta is palatable if you are in a pinch but it's certainly nothing to look forward to.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by this pasta meal. My last experience with microwavable pasta was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035XVQF2">Kraft Easy Mac</a>, and this Barilla product is a huge step forward!<br /><br />The pasta is precooked, so it needs just 60 seconds to heat up. I was afraid of either too hard or soft pasta, but after 60 seconds in the microwave, it was a pleasant al dente. The sauce (which heats beside the pasta in a removable cup) tastes wonderful--neither too sweet nor too acidic. It is a chunky sauce, and the tomato chunks seemed a little slimy. That's probably not a problem for most people, but as a texture person, I didn't enjoy it.<br /><br />Overall, though, this is a great product. It's certainly much better than a brown bag lunch!

review/summary: Nice Taste But Package Difficult to Open
review/text: I frequently buy Barilla pasta sauces, so I was prepared for the sauce to be pleasing and was not disappointed. The pasta was not overcooked if one followed the directions -- I even added another 20 seconds after opening the product and it still had a good texture, slightly chewy, which I like. Both the sauce and the pasta have all natural ingredients, and no preservatives. This would make a good lunch to have on hand in the workplace, as the soft-canning method of producing microwaveable products is becoming more popular. They cook faster than frozen entrees and have the advantage of being stored in one's desk. At only 320 calories, the Mezze Penne with Sauce lunch is satisfying without overloading the diner with calories. As with all pasta, it is high in carbs, which is not an issue for me but I do know people who try to keep their carbs lower. Because sugar is only 7 grams and carbs are 58 grams, there should be no blood sugar spike as occurs when the sugar and carb grams are closer in number. Each serving has 11 grams of protein and 6 of dietary fiber. The one draw back on the nutrition front is the amount of sodium in the serving: 700 mg is close to 1/4 to 1/3 of what most people should be striving to achieve on a daily basis, so you would have to watch your sodium intake for the rest of the day. I sprinkled a little over two teaspoons of grated Parmesan cheese on the pasta, which which brought the sodium content up to about 800 mg. The addition of the cheese was not really necessary, but I generally always add it to pasta dishes.<br /><br />My big problem with the product was the design of the package. It is awkward to open. It has a sauce dish and a pasta dish -- one is supposed to keep a thumb firmly on the sauce dish while at the same time pulling back the film with the other hand, otherwise you could burn your hand with hot sauce while attempting to remove the film. I finally gave up tugging on the film and used a knife to cut it open. The sauce dish then separated from the rest of the container and I poured it over the cooked pasta. Since I am retired, I don't usually buy frozen or soft-canned convenience food, but when I was working I found it to be easy to take to work. I might keep it on hand now for lunch if I don't have time to prepare something more substantial.

review/summary: I really liked this!
review/text: I don't know why I was surprised that this product tastes so good, but I was.  Perhaps it stems from the fact that I've been disappointed in microwave meals so often in the past.  I can now put all that behind me and make sure I have an assortment of these convenient meals in the house for quick, convenient, but most importantly, tasty meals.<br /><br />The packaging is designed so that the pasta sauce and penne noodles stay separate until you mix them together.  I liked it just fine the way the noodles turned out after the 60 seconds, but if you want yours a little softer there are directions for how to do that.  This traditional marinara sauce has lovely chunks of tomato in it.  There are other ingredients also, but nothing overpowers so it all blends well together.  At 24% of daily dietary fiber this is a good source of fiber, but you might need to watch out for the 29% of sodium.<br /><br />This was really a tasty meal which would be good for both lunch or dinner.  I added a salad with mine and it was certainly an ample amount.  I like that it is 100% natural and I like that there are no preservatives added.  And the carton is even made from recycled paper.  So I enjoyed the taste, had an ample serving size (9 oz at 320 calories), and even put the outside cover in my recycle bin so it can be useful again.  Not bad!

review/summary: Probably the Best Microwave Pasta Meal I've Had.
review/text: "Barilla Mezze Penne with Traditional Marinara Sauce" is a 9 oz (255 g) single serving microwave meal that heats up in just one minute. Mezze Penne is smaller than traditional penne, and these have a ridged surface to better hold the sauce. The marinara sauce has a few chunks of tomato in a tomato-herb sauce. The sauce is in a separate container inside the oval serving bowl. Preparation is fast and easy: Peel back the film on the bowl to the dotted line to give it some ventilation. Microwave for 60 seconds. Remove the film carefully to peel it from the pasta bowl as well, where it tends to stick. Pour the sauce over the pasta, stir, and enjoy!<br /><br />My experience with microwave pasta meals is pasta that is overdone on the edges and sauce that is cooked to the bowl in places. Separating the pasta from the sauce has solved some problems. This meal is both tastier, faster, and has better consistency than a frozen microwave dinner. I'm very particular about jarred pasta sauces. Rao's is the only brand I'll buy. Barilla does not make the best jarred sauce, but it is not bad. The sauce is flavorful. The chunks of tomato are few but have good consistency. The pasta was not quite soft enough for me, however. The instructions recommend adding 1 teaspoon of water and microwaving for an additional 30 seconds for softer pasta.<br /><br />This Barilla Penne with Marinara Sauce was better than I expected it to be. It's easily as good as frozen pasta meals that are heated on the stovetop, yet this takes less than 2 minutes from start to finish, and it's convenient for one person. The bowl does not get hot, and it's easy to hold onto from one side that has a wider lip, so it would make a nice quick meal at the office or over a cluttered desk. You don't really have to put the bowl down to eat from it. It contains no preservatives, artificial color, or artificial flavors.<br /><br />Ingredients: cooked mezze penne pasta (water, semolina, durum flour, olive oil, salt, natural flavors), marinara sauce (tomatoes, citric acid, tomato paste, water, carrot puree, olive oil, onion puree, tapioca starch, celery puree, sugar, salt, garlic puree, basil, oregano, natural flavors). Contains per serving: 320 calories, 700mg sodium, 58g carbohydrates, 5g total fat, 1g saturated fat, 11g protein, 180 mcg vitamin A.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy choice
review/text: This microwavable shelf-stable meal from Barilla is surprisingly tasty. It takes only 60 seconds to heat up (unless you add some water to the pasta after the initial 1-minute cooking period and reheat it for 30 more seconds in order to soften the noodles a bit--which I did, and which I recommend). The marinara sauce heats separately from the pasta in a small container attached to the main tray; you simply pour it over the noodles and enjoy. I was impressed by how evenly everything cooked and how well the pasta and the sauce mixed. The noodles were tender, and if you've tried Barilla's jarred sauces, you can expect an almost identical flavor in this meal. At only 320 calories, this is an economical, tasty, and sensible lunch choice.

review/text: I'm always on the lookout for lunches I can take to work and store several in my desk without refrigeration, but that don't taste like pre-prepared food.  This Barilla pasta fits the bill perfectly.  The pasta is already cooked to perfection, and it is stored separately from the sauce, so you don't end up with a watery mess like some competitor products.  The sauce is flavorful enough to be interesting without being overwhelming.  It's a filling meal that is definitely staying on my shopping list.

review/summary: Ok but there are better Barillas.
review/text: Barrilla's pasta is basically canned spaghetti but the sauce is separate - making for firmer, tastier pasta when you heat it. 70 seconds was enough to heat to my taste.<br /><br />I had tried a different Barrilla pasta before and it was a bit too firm.  With this one I tried the alternative cooking method and that worked better.<br /><br />Sauce was TOO SWEET.  No aftertaste so not a disaster.<br /><br />Low fat, (5g/ 1g sat) Sodium 700mg - ok if you're good for 2,000 mg a day. 6g(!) of fiber. That's pretty good.<br /><br />Summary.  It's decent but it wouldn't be my first choice among the Barrilla meals.

review/summary: Yikes!
review/text: Sorry, this was a disaster from the beginning...Here's what just happened...<br /><br />This meal is not frozen, so I followed the instructions as provided. Note that I do use this type of packaged meal quite often, although normally frozen.<br /><br />The package says to pull the top back exposing sauce tray...I did...<br /><br />I microwaved it for 60 seconds. It was not done...<br /><br />I found this out by having part of the sauce fall out all over the place! Fortunately for my hand, it felt cool, thus I knew it wasn't even hot enough to consider eating...<br /><br />At that point, I saw that the sauce was in a separate container and, though holding it by my thumb as explained I had to pull so hard (something I didn't realize I would be doing or I would have cut it open) to continue to get the top off, that the sauce flew out, together with the separate cup coming partially out!<br /><br />Packaging is definitely a problem! I've never had this type of issue with any other company's product and that includes Stouffers down to Banquet which is just about the least expensive of this type of food...<br /><br />I then tasted the pasta...Now I like al dente...but this just was not done.<br /><br />For this type of food, I taste it to see how it "tastes" as made by the company. I was disappointed.<br /><br />Soooooo, I added onion and garlic power, salt, pepper and a little buttered oil...<br /><br />THEN I cooked it an additional minute beyond the instructions. Note that my microwave heats high and I rarely use the time suggested...so I have confidence that the instructions for heating will not make the meal hot enough for any microwave...<br /><br />With all the additional herbs/spices, I was able to enjoy the pasta.<br /><br />For 320 calories, I've tasted better and more pasta coming from other companies. There is no sweetner which I usually add to my own spaghetti, but I didn't add that for this trial. Without anything, this would be a very bland meal indeed.<br /><br />The sauce and pasta itself was fine for basic ingredients...but given the packaging, poor instructions, and lack of any "true taste" in the sauce. I certainly wouldn't buy it nor recommend it. Given the name, I had expected a tasty Italian sauce. Better check out Stouffers--their sauce needs little added, if anything! Too bad, because a package that does not require refrigeration would be useful to working people.

review/summary: I liked it at first...
review/text: The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/summary: Great flavored tea
review/text: This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online.

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/text: This tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store, so I bought it online. Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications (statins in particular), I figured, why not--I drink tea, so I can try this one. It tastes ok. Not great. But drinkable.<br />I think this tea is a fair alternative to taking another pill.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/summary: Awesome Tea
review/text: I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!

It has a real earthy, almost "manure" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said "Oh, that's not bad!" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!

I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two.<br />At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful. Just remember to tell your midwife or doctor that you're using it. I still drink it just cause I like it.

I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.

review/summary: Mild sweet tea
review/text: I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.

review/text: this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs. today i weigh 190, today meaning march 20, 2012. i have a long way to<br />go but that is a good start for me i love food it is hard but i find lowfat and sugarfree things to snack on. being overweight makes you tired easily, and the more tired you feel the more you will just sit around and when you sit around,<br />yep you tend to snack. my goal is 170 pounds, yea that is still a lot of weight but i am a realistic person, i will not<br />set myself up for a let down. if a should lose anything beyond 170 i will be very happy, i will update my quest on april 20, 2012. thanks

Obviously, my experience made me a believer!<br /><br />I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands.

It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.<br />I would say go for it, if you need to get a jump start but DONT expect a good tasting tea very bitter. I DONT sweeten at all, I break the bags so i can swallow some of the bark in the tea as well. Good Luck

review/summary: No more breast milk!
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply.

From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.

review/summary: Recommended by herbalist--love it.
review/text: We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in.

review/summary: Red Raspberry Leaf Tea
review/text: I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead.

review/summary: I use this tea for menstral cramps
review/text: I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot.

review/summary: Birthing Miracle Tea
review/text: I also had heard from my lamaze class that red rasberry tea was suppose to ease and assist in the birthing process(It is a uterine toner). Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery.

review/text: This tea really works. Drink a big cup before bed and in the morning you will have to use the bathroom. Sometimes I have to eat just a little something before it kicks in, but it always works within 1-2 hours after waking up. It does not really taste that great, but it is okay. Definitely helps me keep my weight even.<br /><br />Personally I like Kleritea better (more gentle, tastes better) but that costs almost 4 times as much. So I stick to Alvita Senna Leaf Tea now.

I have continued to drink this every night and I still sleep well but I find myself waking up in the middle of the night once in a while.  I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out.  No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed.  I recommended this to my family and co workers and they all love it.  I discovered this from Dr. Oz.  Hoping to continue to sleep well.

review/summary: Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me
review/text: I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

review/summary: A great product, you must try!
review/text: I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.

Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs. This tea has an obvious effect, though it takes about half an hour to kick in. I smells like crap, but if you mix it with mint tea, it isn't as noticeable. I don't see any problem with the flavor, it does not taste like it smells.

review/text: I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know.

review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

review/summary: Please get past the taste.
review/text: You can compare it to unsweetened black tea, but palpable and soothing.  It is one of nature's best blood purifiers in addition to being great for women anytime.  It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this.<br /><br />You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better.

review/text: I bought this because I heard about the benefits of Sage tea. I got used to the taste pretty quickly and love to pour it in a glass of ice to enjoy during the summer days.<br /><br />I took a star off because I've been drinking it for several weeks and I'm not seeing the work of benefits that is claimed of Sage tea (but then, I've always believed that you lose some benefits when the teas are in bags as opposed to still being in leaf form?).

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

review/text: When I opened this alot of the tea sacks were broken and the tea emptied out and spilled everywhere. I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile. However, if they'd be able to keep the sacks closed that would help alot!

review/summary: Sage Tea - helping with hot flashes
review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

Add some sugar and you're good to go.

review/summary: Interesting taste
review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

Drinking Fenugreek tea, taking L-Arginine supplements and getting a good nights' sleep (6 hour min.). Well, I am going to give it a shot. This tea has an interesting taste-not your typical tea but not bad. It tastes pretty good with a bit of honey added actually. I wasn't able to find this tea in any local supermarkets but here it is on Amazon. Seems they have everything!

I'm in amazement at how much it helps!<br /><br />The taste isn't great, but I don't think it's as bad as some other reviews have said. If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/summary: Great for potty training!!
review/text: I adopted a 1 year old Yorkie rescue pup who is only semi potty trained. I was having some troubles getting him to potty outside today (like most days). Then these awesome treats arrived! I ordered the Zukes mini naturals roasted chicken treats last night and they were already here this morning with Prime. I gave him one to taste test and he gobbled it up and instantly wanted another. I then grabbed two of them, went outside with him knowing I had the treats in hand and I asked him to go potty. He went instantly! I think tasty treats really do make a big difference. These are also nice and small so giving them a few isn't going to pile on the pounds. We are feeding our pups a grain free dog food so it only makes sense to get grain free treats too. I will be back for more of these for sure both of my pups LOVE these!!!

review/text: Our dog loves these.  We started her on it when she was 7 weeks old (and had about 4 teeth), and she loved it.  She was still too young to eat milk bones or even beggin' strips, but she could eat these.  I also don't feel bad about giving these to her because they are only 3.5 calories each. There is a rapid change in behavior when she hears me open up the treat bag... she sits, stops chewing, and starts randomly performing tricks, hoping to get one... it's pretty funny. We have repurchased these and will continue to do so.

In fact, he grazes.  But when I unseal the package of Zuke's, he bounds at me bouncing in the air.  I taught him "sit" in two minutes using Zuke's (Chicken).  My 19 month old Catahoula Leopard Dog-girl loves them, too.<br /><br />I like the small size of these treats (it's easy to carry them in a snack size ziploc) -- perfect for training/rewards.  I pretty exclusively purchase natural, high quality food/treats for my animals companions.  Zuke's is our household's favorite canine treat!

review/summary: Good size for training
review/text: My dog loves these and they're my training treats of choice.  I've only tried the chicken flavor.<br /><br />They're semi-moist, not messy, and pretty small.  They're not scored, but can still be halved or quartered with a sharp knife or a long fingernail.  Each piece has 3 calories.  For med-small dogs, you can cut them down into really tiny bits and still make a dog happy.  If you quarter them, you could give 20 rewards during training and only be adding 15 calories.<br /><br />The bag has a reclosable seal, and you'll need it because they dry out and get hard and crumbly if left exposed.  If I take some with me away from the house, I put precut treats in a snack-sized zip bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />They also come in a larger sized bag which is more economical.

review/summary: Great for training
review/text: We have tried a lot of different treats (Milo's kitchen meatballs, Train-Me treats, etc), all of which were great, but I have settled on Zuke's because they are already the right size for a small dog and seem to be made with not too many fillers.  I have a 2 1/2 year old rescue who had a lot of 'tude for 11 lbs.  We adopted her a year ago supposedly already house- and crate trained, but she was absolutely neither. Apart from great advice on aspca.org, it takes a TON of treats to start training an adult dog from scratch.  Of course we used plenty of things around the house (cut up string cheese, hard boiled eggs, stuffed frozen peanut butter in Kongs), but sometimes you don't have anything prepared and you have to crate the dog and get to work. She loves these treats and has proved a quick study.  Happy treating!

review/summary: A Quality Dog Snack
review/text: Using Zuke's mini snack for my 6 1/2 month Siberian Husky has been fantastic. Before starting her on Obedience classes I was required to find something she really went for. I guess it was the trainer's way of making her training easier for her. This natural product has been amazing! It's chewy and savory and just right for my picky dog/pup. Except my pup prefers the beef flavor but thankfully she is now becoming a well-behaved dog.

review/summary: Great Training Treats
review/text: My dogs love these treats - especially the Chicken flavor. They are small, but I find them to be perfect for training.  They are small, low in calories and of high quality so I don't feel bad about giving quite a few out when the dogs are working on learning new things or reinforcing good behavior.  The price on Amazon is much better than my local vendor and delivery is always fast.  Highly recommended.

review/text: A trainer suggested these treats over a year ago and once I bought them I never when back to hotdogs.  They are really easy to use and my dogs love them.  When I trained our smaller dog, they were easy to break apart.  Ever since I used them the first time I became a loyal Zuke's convert!

review/summary: Perfect for training
review/text: My husband and I are vegetarians and we were looking for a treat we could use for our puppy's training sessions that wouldn't gross us out. We typically make our own peanut butter dog treats for our dogs, but they're too big and too crunchy to work for training. These moist mini peanut butter flavor treats are perfect! They don't gross us out and both our dogs (the puppy and our 2 year old dog) LOVE them and are highly motivated during training sessions.

review/summary: I think they're bland, but my puppy loves them
review/text: The aroma of these treats is fantastic--there's a tantalizing meaty, smokey smell that wafts from the bag. And the texture of the treats are pleasingly soft and moist. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed when I tried them. I think they are rather bland, and because they are coarsely ground there are hard bits of stuff in them, one of which got caught between my teeth. I think they could have used a little bit more salt. Also, they're a little small so it takes a lot to fill me up.<br /><br />On the other hand, my puppy loves these things and they have been great motivators for teaching her tricks, so I guess they have that going for them.

review/summary: dog loves 'em
review/text: These are definitely "MINI".  I guess I wasn't really paying attention when I ordered them, bc it looks like hamster food.  My dog still loves it.  I usually grab a small handful and throw them in her bowl.  She never complains.  that being said, here is my review from another order from this dog treat line.  It still applies to this product!<br />I try to stick to all natural products in my household.  That goes double for my dog.  she is a super mutt with a strong stomach, but that doesn't mean I want to take any chances.  these seem like quality treats and she really enjoys them. I have purchased several flavors and she loves them all.  will definitely buy them again.

review/summary: perfect treats
review/text: These are sooo great for training. I just stick a few in my back pocket, usually even break them into halves or thirds and use as treats. My dog loves them, and while she isn't the pickiest, she certainly doesn't like some treats. The real reason they are great though is because she likes them enough so that she will do her tricks for only a third of the treat! (This is an extremely tiny portion, which shows how flavorful they are.) And if they estimate correctly that's only one calorie of her diet! Can't go wrong, I've had chicken and salmon and both are great.

review/text: These treats are a great choice. There all natural. My pom mix has a very sensitive tummy and this treat does not bother him. As soon as I grab the bag my dogs try to do there tricks as fast as they can to get one of these. There soft in texture and the size is great for my 3 month old chi mix who is only 4 lbs. The only reason I gave this treat 4 stars is because they smell horrible other than that if you can deal with the smell. I recommend these! especially to anyone how has a small dog or a dog with a sensitive tummy!

review/summary: Perfect size, but goes quickly
review/text: Like everyone else, I bought these because they are all natural with no byproducts and they're the perfect size for training. I have a Pomeranian puppy and since he was 7 weeks old, I've had him on Blue Buffalo Wilderness Puppy formula which has worked wonders for him and he cannot get enough of. He's now 7 months old and he's as perfect as can be. Prior to trying Zuke's, I used to feed him Pup-Peroni since he loved them, considering that he has a sensitive stomach, it worked for him. After my last batch was almost done, I figured I would buy a couple packs of Zuke's.<br /><br />Of course, his stomach has to get used to the product but his bowels has been watery and not as dense and hard as when he was on Pup-Peroni. He's been on Zuke's for a week and a half and he's still getting used to it. Also, the product goes really quickly as I only have a couple ounces left. So I'd say that 16oz lasts two weeks whereas 16oz of the Pup-Peroni lasted a lot longer.<br /><br />I'm thinking about switching over to the Pup-Peroni if his stools remains watery and soft as it's been 1.5 weeks since he's been getting Zuke's. I still have another pound of the Peanut Butter, so we'll see. All-in-all, my little man loves this stuff even if his stomach isn't digesting it normally.

review/summary: Great Training Treats
review/text: These treats are perfect for training.  They do not crumble and a dog can eat them quickly and easily.  A dog will not lose focus since he won't have to stop and eat.  I actually cut them in quarters for agility class.<br /><br />As far as flavors, my dogs will eat anything.  From the owner's perspective, the salmon smell so much better than the chicken.  The chicken has a typical dog food meat smell, but the salmon does not smell like dog food at all.

review/summary: My pup loves Zuke's!
review/text: I have been buying these treats both on amazon and at my local pet stores for almost 2 years now.  They are the perfect size for a training treat, they fit nicely into some treat dispensing toys (like the artichoke one that Planet Dog makes), and my dog loves the taste! They are moist, but they have a tendency to get dried out if you don't reseal the bag after opening. They are made in the U.S. and don't have any wheat or corn products in them.  They're also only 3 calories each, and perfect for training since they don't completely fill my dog up!

review/text: These treats are awesome. My dog is 12 pounds and these are perfect for him. He loves soft treats and the stinkier the better so this is right up his alley. I have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKTG">Ourpets DT-10504 Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball , 5 Inches , Colors may vary</a>and these treats are the perfect size for it. They roll out easily but not TOO easily so it keeps him busy for at least an hour. I got the chicken flavor and my dog thinks they're great. I love them because they are healthier for him than the other treats we'd been giving him and they are great to train with. I'm glad it comes in the 16 ounce bag because we go through them pretty quick!

review/summary: Good til the last treat
review/text: Usually I don't write reviews, but who really does unless the product is either outstanding or absolutely horrible. Thankfully this review is not the latter. When I initially got my puppy she was not house-trained, didn't know any tricks and was not food motivated. However, with these treats she was potty-trained and knows quite a few tricks. It was effort on my part, but those treats were definitely a good motivator. Also, looking around at other treats and their prices these are a really great value. If you want something that your dog will enjoy and a great value for the amount and type of treat this is what you want to look for. You and your dog won't be disappointed. I know mine isn't.

review/summary: Great For Service Dogs!
review/text: My greyhound service dog loves these treats! I use them for training or reinforcing good behavior while out. They aren't too stinky, aren't too big, and are really healthy. An additional plus for service dogs is that these treats are soft, so there's no loud crunching sound when you use them in the library or in that quiet waiting room at the doctor's office. The small, round design means you'll fit a lot of these into a typical training pouch, so you won't run out. One note I would add is that, if you don't use them all on a particular outing, be sure to dump the unused treats back in the resealable bag or they may get hard. Other than that, these really are the perfect training/reinforcement treat for service dogs! Great stuff!

review/summary: Did they change the recipe for these??? Rosemary and cherries?
review/text: I have ordered these just a few times for our new puppy and recieved exactly the picture shown (the chicken flavor) but I just re-ordered a new bag and thought I was getting exactly what I had ordered previously but this one is slightly differt.  They have added 'anti-oxidents' to the recipe so it has cherry, rosmary and some other things added.  They are still the small round training treats and are still great (a little more calories at 3.5 per treat instead of 2) but I found it interesting that it wasn't as advertised by amazon.  Do they still sell the old ones or has Zuke's just changed their items?  FYI, I chose the '1 pound' option in the drop-down when I ordered.<br />I still give this 5 stars because I think they are the best treats out there for training, they are small, moist, stinky (that's good for dogs) and made with healthy quality ingredients.  Just not sure if Zuke's changed them or if I was sent something slightly different by accient.  I guess I will find out next time I try to order them!

review/summary: Nuts for these!!!
review/text: We adopted a 10 month mix breed and needed to tap into his hunting breed's tendencies and these treats are the only reason our guy gets excited about training and hunting for treats.<br /><br />We ordered a Kong Wobbler too and these treats are the perfect size and shape to put inside and keep him entertained for awhile.  They're great for having on hand just as treats or as rewards while working on training.  You can carry alot and it not be awkward.<br /><br />He loves the chicken flavor and can't seem to get enough.  I love the price for the size of the bag you get and they last a good while as long as you ration.  Even though they are definitely "mini", each one has such a strong (not overwhelming) aroma and taste that just that little morsel is enough for our big guy.  His nose knows.<br /><br />I'm ordering more today and will continue to order as long as they're available.  Just wish they were on auto delivery.  We'd never want to run out.  Any other treat just won't do.  I highly recommend you at least try them.  You and your pooch will be glad you did.

I found these mini treats, and the bag had awesome reviews from a good amount of people. The treats weren't pricey at all, and I went ahead and bought them. My dog absolutely loves these. They're moist, small, and perfect for training. She listens so well when I bring these out, and she hasn't gotten tired of them at all. She's perfected two new tricks on top of repeating her old ones in just a matter of one day! The only negative I would say is that they do have a particular smell since they are very moist and natural. Overall, these treats are a huge success!

review/summary: Zuke's Salmon, Chicken, and Rabbit work well for my picky dog!
review/text: I've been using Zuke's Mini's for training since I first brought my girl home and she (surprisingly, for she's quite picky) still tolerates them and *sometimes* even seems to want to work for them. (Not having a food motivated dog SUCKS for training - I could literally be walking around with big macs in my pockets and it just wouldn't matter) They are low calorie and reasonably cheap (I can actually find them at some local stores cheaper than I can on Amazon, sometimes) as the bags tend to last a while. (I actually use kibble mixed with the treats when working with her, becuase I'm sneaky like that and she doesn't notice the difference once we get going)<br /><br />Of course not all dogs work with all treats - and it SHOULD be noted that although these treats do not have a lot of the "bad" ingredients in them they still do have grains. (NO grain treats have a much different texture, either from being pure meat or using various ingredients as the "binder" necessary for treats like this)<br /><br />This is the only type of treat we feed that has grains in it; almost everything else she eats is pure meat in various fashions. (lamb lung, water buffalo, venison, rabbit, etc)<br /><br />If you have a dog with allergies you may want to try some of the grain-free options for training treats, like the mini lamb lungs or mini beef jerkies, etc. For our needs, though, these are perfect. \<br /><br />I was SO psyched when I saw that they came out with the "rabbit" variety! I try to keep the variety going in her diet and she doesn't like the peanut butter kind so it was always down to alternating between chicken or salmon, both of which are very common proteins. I can't tell if she likes this kind more or not, but she's definitely eating them which is a good sign! They tend to be more expensive than the other variety so I don't buy them as often, but love including it in the mix!<br /><br />One last thing I wanted to mention, my Mom has small dogs (tiny chihuahuas) and they can eat this size training treat with ease. However, I recently purchased the SMALL training treats for her (they are usually about 1/2 cal per treat) and she said that they are PERFECT for her sized dogs that she is constantly trying to diet. I don't believe they are made in that size by Zuke's but there are several brands out there that also use similar ingredients (no bad preservatives, no corn, by products, etc) that may work better for very small dogs.

review/text: My dog LOVES these treats. They tend to have a very strong fish oil smell. So if you are afraid of the fishy smell, don't get it. But I think my dog likes it because of the smell. These treats are really small in size. They are great for training. You can give your dog several of these without worrying about him over eating. Amazon's price was much more reasonable than any other retailer. You can buy a 1 pound bag on Amazon for almost the same price as a 6 ounce bag at other retailers. It's definitely worth it to buy a big bag if your dog eats them a lot.

review/summary: Favorite Treats!
review/text: I have a 10 month old weimaraner who is allergic to beef which makes finding treats a bit of a challenge.  Luckily we found Zuke's right away!  There is no beef, wheat, or corn in them.  With their small size (about the size of a pencil eraser) and moist texture, they are the best for training and reinforcing good behavior.  We've tried the chicken, peanut butter, and salmon flavors, and the salmon are definitely her favorite.  Next up - I think I'll get the rabbit flavor for her to try!

review/summary: Yummy doggy dots
review/text: I didn't realize when i bought these that they were going to be so small, so as a treat for anything larger than a yorkie you might have to use a small handful of these. Great for my dog outside of the size because they are grain free and have no fillers which my dog is allergic to. They must taste good because the dog cant wait to get a treat after he walk outside.

review/summary: Great yummy treat for my little ones
review/text: I got a border collie puppy recently and have been working on training her. She's so smart so it's nice but she's tiny so most treats are kind of big for her. I didn't want her training treats to take her a bit to chew on. So these are great and trust me she goes BONKERS over them. I wash my hands after the training sessions because she goes crazy over the lingering smell too. I also have 2 cats and they both show up when the bag opens. They have PLENTY of their own treats but they love these yummy morsels. I'll be buying them the Zukes cat treats so they can enjoy them just as much

review/summary: Zukes Mini Naturals - Healthy Treats
review/text: Our toy poodle loves these treats!  We use them for training and for maintaining bathroom breaks outside.  We use these smaller treated for "pee" rewards and larger ones of another brand for "poo" rewards.  At first I thought this would be excessive, but when we tried to stop and she had a set back of accidents in the house we felt the rewards were a far better price to pay than messes in the house and punishing our dog.  So this way everyone is happy.  Since we give rewards several times daily we felt having all natural treats was a far better choice.  We have trained our dog to lay down while we are eating so no more begging; to roll over; sit; and stay using these treats.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces
review/text: My dog loves Zukes Mini Natural Treats! treats.  He expects them before he goes to sleep for the evening, and often looks for them when we just tell him he is as good boy.  When we run out of them he actually pouts because now he expects them every day.  What I like about these treats for our dog is that they are natural, no chemicals, and just the right size for our dog to chew (he is 28 lbs.).  Also, some of the proceeds go toward Cancer Research for animals, which I am all for since we lost a Jack Russell to cancer at the age of 5 (Lymphoma).  Very sad to see an animal suffer with Cancer, as with a human, and also to lose them, which is especially emotionally stressful.  We will purchase Zukes as long as our dog loves them - and we know this will be for his life.

review/text: My 10 week old learned out to sit, rollover, shake, and open a beer in 20 minutes with these.  Kidding on that part but he actually was attentive to his owner knowing that he would get this treat.  Definitely well for training, especially being all natural and only 2 cals each!  We have the lamb jerky as well, that he may enjoy even more (if possible) however it's not a treat for training due to the size and texture but I recommend those as well.  We start obedience class next week so hopefully they don't lost their magic :)

review/summary: Perfect training treats
review/text: My beagle-daschund Pixel needed a lot of re-training when I got her, as her previous "owner" had neglected her for several months. The Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats were perfect for use in training, because they're small, low-calorie, and healthy, so I didn't feel like I was over-feeding her by using them throughout the day.<br /><br />Despite the fact that Pixel had a very sensitive stomach when I first got her, these treats never made her sick (her previous "owner" had not fed her regularly, she was underweight, and the food she had gotten was of poor quality, so for several weeks after I got her, most foods made her sick).<br /><br />I still use these treats, as they're made from good, simple ingredients, they're free of wheat/corn/soy, and they're low-calorie. Plus, Pixel loves them!<br /><br />A tip for using these tiny treats: I fill a plastic medicine bottle with these treats (they're small, and about 15 will fit in the container), and keep it in my jacket pocket to use while on walks.<br /><br />I also filled a medicine bottle with these and I keep it in the car, which has been useful in two ways. First, it's nice to have a treat for Pixel when she goes in the car. Second, while driving I have encountered my neighbor's escaped dog twice in the past few months, and having treats with me makes it much easier to catch her and return her to her home!

review/text: I used to give my 7 month Lab mix puppy Blue Buffalo Bits but I stopped because of the price and this resulted to be a great substitute! These are a whole lot cheaper - I paid about $7 for a 1lb bag of treats and my puppy enjoys them. They are a little "greasy" but that's expected since they are 'moist'. I usually train my puppy with a mix of kibble, biscuits and cut up greenies and this is a great addition to the mix.

review/summary: Perfect for puppy training class!! She loves it!!
review/text: My 8 month old golden retriever is surprisingly very picky about food. Our training class uses positive reinforcement with treats and lots of them. The last class, I ran out of hot dogs, and my puppy decided she didn't like bologna, or cheese anymore (which was all I had left) and was over it! She lost interest in training for the day after that.<br />I got home and decided to look for a really enticing treat that she will love and I found these on Amazon and for a great price too! She LOVES it and it's small enough and plentiful enough that a bag should last me at least a few weeks or longer of training.

review/text: My dogs love these and they smell so good I have been tempted to try them!!!  I bought the chicken variety.  They are way small so great for training purposes so that you don't overfeed your dog in the process of teaching him good behaviors.  Plus, they are natural so must be good for the doggies.  I will definitely order them again when we run out.  Shipping wasn't the speediest on this item which I found strange because I have the Amazon prime 2 day shipping.  Not super slow, but it was longer than a week before I got them so I had to buy some others to use in the meantime.  Maybe it got lost in the mail, not sure.  One of my dogs will not stop begging for these when he sees I have the treat pouch!

review/text: I am all about providing my puppy (6mo. shihpoo) all natural treats in moderation.  After signing up for a puppy class and him learning some things, I am making sure to reward him when he listens and obeys commands.  After a while you realize that your choice of treats becomes very important to keep him happy and healty.  I saw this had high reviews here so I decided to give them a show.  He really likes them!  They are nice and small so he can easily chew and swallow them, and the bag is huge!  I am used to buying the Blue Buffalo treats so this seems to be a bit more bang for the buck :)  The only "con" is that they really are smelly (chicken flavor).  Not sure about the other flavors but they smell like a bottle of vitamins.

We haven't really started training her but giving them to her every time she goes potty outside rather than inside is working out great.

review/text: Izzy, our rescue Mini Schnauzer, has tummy issues. We've had to go to a sensitive stomach dog food, and be very careful with what we feed her for snacks and treats. We've been looking for treats she'll like, with ingredients she can have, and made in the United States. With Zuke's we get it all.<br /><br /> We also have to limit how much treat she can get in a day, but with the small size of these treats, about the size of pencil eraser tips, so we can give her 3 or 4 and use them as rewards when training.<br /><br />She loves the salmon flavor, and while I can smell they are salmon, they don't stink and my hands aren't gross after giving Izzy her treats. So far we have hadn't any bad reactions and she enjoys getting a yummy treat, she doesn't have to know it's good for her too!

review/text: Small and soft enough for a quick reward when training my puppy. It doesn't hurt that she also loves them. They do smell strong but nothing worse than typical dog food, plus the odor keeps her attention. The only downside (if you would call it that) is that they are a little on the "oily" side. Just a tad but enough to keep a lingering smell if you don't wash your hands right away, which I would do any way so really is no big deal.

review/text: I bought these over a year ago on the recommendation of a dog trainer. I had tried several others, all of which were OK.  These are the most strong-smelling and apparently tasting treats I have ever seen, and our Lab really responded to them.  You do have to keep them in a sealed container or they will dry out.  They are a bit expensive compared to some others, but  I found that I could cut them in half and get the same effect when using for training (and save a few bucks).

review/summary: perfect!
review/text: These are the perfect treats for training. My dog loves them and because they are moist and so tiny I don't feel bad about giving him multiple treats for completing tricks or good behavior. It is so convenient not having to break treats up into tiny pieces and you really get a lot for your money. These last me quite awhile and the resealable bag helps to keep them fresh. I would highly recommend this treats!

review/text: Zukes is a treat my puppy loves and is good for her.  I bought the salmon flavor and the 1 lbs. package lasts a long time which makes it a great value.  You can buy the 16 ounce package on amazon with prime for about the same amount as the 8 ounce package in a pet store!  Thanks Amazon!!

review/summary: Little doggie attention magnets!
review/text: I am a trainer at a local no-kill shelter.  I work with all different types and temperaments of dog, and the only common denominator is that I need their undivided attention and a reward they'll do almost anything for.  Plus, being a wide population, I needed something with a simple ingredient list (so as to avoid digestive issues).  THIS IS THE TREAT!  I am a huge fan of Zuke's already, but was dubious as to whether or not one type of treat would suit the tastes of so many different dogs.  The chicken flavor has yet to fail me.<br /><br />Low-calorie, a universally appealing flavor and the perfect training size.  Bonus for trainers: they don't smell half bad!  However, their scent is still strong enough to work as a puzzle toy filler, a Kong filling, for tracking or scent games or to just grab focus from an enticing squirrel. ;)<br /><br />Even previously feral and non-treat-motivated dogs seem quite happy that I bring these.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: love the natural ingredients!
review/text: I only feed my dog organic products treats and I love the ingredients in these treats.  Even better, my dogs love them too.  They are small and perfect for training.  Although I think they smell repulsive my labs cannot get enough of them.  They will harden over time, they are super-moist to begin with.  But I have found that they stay fresh much longer if you keep them in the refrigerator<br /><br />I also recommend the american chicken jerky that comes with the skin and coat optimizer, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093W6YCE">K9 Showstopper (Unflavored) 4 Lbs. + Free American Chicken Jerky - 3 Oz.</a>.  Another favorite in this household, they go crazy when they see the bag.  The jerky does come in much bigger pieces but they are easy to break into two, which I usually do and share half with each dog.  Now if I only watched my own diet as much as I did my dogs, I may actually get somewhere, lol.<br /><br />One thing is for sure, Amazon definitely has the best prices for pet treats and supplies.  I've seen these products at the store marked up almost double!  Cannot say that about everything Amazon carries but for these categories they seem to have cornered the market.

review/summary: Salmon Dog Treats
review/text: Mini Naturals - 1 pound - Salmon Flavored<br />Great product for training dogs!  I use them all the time for training (walking on a lead, sitting, fetching).  They are high in flavor so even with our 7 month Golden Retriever, treats cut in half work well for a reward.  Unlike dog kibble or other treats, these are quickly digested so that your dog will not be gagging on them as he/she works on the next behavior.  To keep fresh, keep bag tightly closed and put a portion of the cut treats in a resealable sandwich bag.  If they do get exposed to air and dry out, a small portion of a moistened paper towel in the bag will restore them to original texture.

review/summary: Dog likes them!
review/text: My dog likes these treats, but definitely prefers the peanut butter ones better.  One strange thing I've noticed with these treats is that they tend to harden very quickly -- so you're best off buying the small bag (seen here), not the bigger bag.  It's strange -- the salmon flavor does harden faster than the peanut butter flavor.  But, all in all, they're a good treat to feed your dog because they're so small.  They're perfect for training, and Zuke's is always full of good things, not some crappy ingredients like some other dog treats out there.

review/text: Surprised of the bad reviews because of the smell, . . .come on seriously?  Dog lick their privates and smell each others butts.  I mean the smell is hardly that of a baked apple pie but I love that these treats are made of natural ingredients.  I also love the perfect pea sized shape.  Not to much and not to little.  My puppy loves the stuff and I've gotten him to do all sorts of things.  Catch a frisbee, sit, down, shake, sit pretty, play dead, roll over, fetch, touch a target, say his prayers, stay, and come and he's only 4 months old.  I make sure that I adjust his feeding when I treat so that he does not over eat for the day.  These are great.  I buy the peanut butter flavor.

review/summary: Great in Every Way Except they STINK!!
review/text: I like almost everything about these treats (I got the chicken).  They're small (though I still cut them in half when I'm not feeling lazy), perfect size for a quick training treat so that your dog can be rewarded but his attention stays on you (rather than on eating the treat).<br /><br />I like the texture.  They are moist but not wet so there is no sticky residue.<br /><br />The price is good.<br /><br />The ingredients are ok.  Not great, despite the "natural" claim, but I don't necessarily expect treats to be healthy.<br /><br />But, and it's a big but, they stink to high heaven.  In fact, they stink so bad that I have to hold my breath whenever I open the bag, otherwise I will truly gag.  I can't describe the smell but despite the "natural" ingredients, they smell nothing like what you would find in nature.  These treats have been so highly processed that the original ingredients are beyond recognition.<br /><br />Actually, the smell reminds me of kibble.  I haven't fed my dogs kibble in over a decade, but whenever we dogsit and I get a whiff of our friends' dogs' kibble, I want to gag too.  But the smell of Zuke's is at least 6 times stronger.  I hate how the odor lingers on my fingers after I've handled the treats.<br /><br />In fact, for a couple of days, while working at my desk, I would get a strong whiff of what smelled like crab.  I had eaten a whole crab a couple of weeks ago and kept smelling my clothes, thinking that the crab smell hadn't washed out.  But my clothes smelled clean.  It wasn't until a couple of days later that I discovered the origin of that crabby smell.  It was coming from a treat pouch I had put the Zuke's in and had left on the far corner of my desk about 4 feet away.  If laundering doesn't remove that smell, I'm going to have to toss that pouch.<br /><br />I feed raw green tripe to my dogs on a regular basis, and while some have likened the smell of that to sewage, I don't actually find the odor too offensive.  Certainly isn't pretty but not enough to make me want to vomit.  Zuke's actually makes me want to do that.  It's unfortunate that they stink so much to me, because I would buy more otherwise.  However, I will say that the 1 possible benefit of their intense odor is that it does get the dogs' attention and they don't seem to mind it.<br /><br />But I guess I'll go back to making my own treats.  Chicken/turkey heart or liver, cut up into pieces, then boiled.  Pat dry, then stick in oven on low until dehydrated.  Dogs love them just as much, and not only are they TRULY natural, they are human-grade, minimally processed, and actually healthy.  The things I do for my dogs.

review/text: Our puppy loves these little treats! They are small enough to give him a few at a time, but I like to cut them up even smaller and use them for training. They are tiny as is (about the size of a pencil eraser), but can easily be cut into quarters for reward-based training. I will always keep these in stock for him!

review/summary: My dogs like them, but they STINK!
review/text: We got the salmon and the peanut butter flavors for our puppies, and they go crazy for them. They were really hard to potty train, but these were small and healthy enough that we were able to give them to our dogs every time they pottied outside. They worked great for that, and our dogs finally got the message! But they really don't smell appetizing, and even one of the salmon ones will make their breath smell terrible for a whole day!<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars for that reason. If your dogs like them as much as ours do, I think it's well worth the stinky breath.

review/text: I read that chicken jerky from China is dangerous for dogs so I was looking for another treat they would eat.  This was not one of them.  It didn't matter how hungry they got, they wouldn't eat these.  They sat on the floor two days.  I picked them up, threw them away and then tried again a few days later with fresh treats.  I left them in their treat spots.  They sat there for days.  They would not eat them.  It doesn't help if they were made in America but my dogs find them unpalatable.

review/summary: Chicken-Flavored Treats
review/text: This review is for Zuke's Chicken-Flavored treats.<br /><br />The only problem I have with these treats is their overwhelming smell. It's not pleasant at all, almost like they're on the verge of spoiling. I've left the bag open accidentally and returned to the whole lower level of my house reeking. Even after putting them in a sandwich baggy for training during our walking session, the smell clung to my coat. Basically, anything these things touch, they'll share their smell with.<br /><br />Stench aside, these are fabulous treats. My dog responds more readily to them during our training sessions than any others I've tried so far (guess what disgusts me smells like heaven to him). They're also already the perfect size, which is very convenient.<br /><br />I'll definitely try out some different flavors next time.

I appreciate the quality of the ingredients.  It's not easy to find good treats which don't require refrigeration.  These are small and soft and perfect for class.  They have enough smell/taste appeal to compete with other normal training class environment. I've purchased these in a number of flavors for use in classes and with my own dogs. I recommend them to my students because of the quality and convenience.

Additionally, I add these to her prescription diet dog food for dogs with sensitive stomachs and she eats her meal. She is a very high maintenance but adorable and loving.

review/summary: Low Cal and Delicious
review/text: My dog loves these treats and I love them because they are low calorie.  I was always worried when using other treats during training because I always felt as if I was giving him far too many calories.  Now I am able to extend my training lessons while feeling comfortable that I am not overfeeding him.  They also have a nice moist feeling that I am sure my dog loves.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product

review/summary: Great for training, dog loves these!
review/text: My 4-month chocolate lab loves these! I like the tiny size of the treat because believe me, treats pile on the weight! I got Salmon ones because I figured that the Salmon oil in the treats may be good for his skin and coat but seriously, they are stinky. I keep them with all his other treats and if I've forgotten to seal the bag, the whole cabinet starts smelling! They do harden up if you've left the bag open. My dog is a typical lab and very very food motivated. I try and keep mixing his treats to keep him motivated and these are definitely treats he'll do anything for!

I ordered a bag to try then ordered two more shortly after. Only thing I found was strage is that the packaging went from 2 calories to 3 per treat- no biggie just weird.

review/summary: Great treat for training!!!!
review/text: These treats are the best.  I use them for training my dog and my cat begs for the salmon ones!! Regarding the comment about the treats hardening.  This is true if you don't keep them in the sealed bag. However, I find that if the bag is sealed they stay soft and chewy. When I forget and leave a few in my pockets they do turn into little pebbles. Small price to pay for no preservatives!!

review/summary: Good product, but packaging problem
review/text: My Wheaten puppy likes these treats and I like that they're made from good ingredients. But I gave this product three stars, because there was a problem with its packaging. The interlocking seal doesn't line up, so the bag is impossible to close. I guess I'll just repackage the treats myself. It's not a huge problem, but I'm just a little disappointed.

review/summary: Leo would walk through fire for salmon, through rain for peanut butter
review/text: I bought Zuke's mini treats in Salmon (and then in peanut butter) to re-enforce good walking behavior for my Australian Cattle Dog, Leo.  I liked the fact that they had no added chemicals and were only 2 calories each. They are similar in texture to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D2578G">Pup-Peroni Original Beef Recipe, 5.6-Ounces (Pack of 4)</a>, but they do not contain by-products, corn syrup, onion powder (onions are toxic to dogs), or nitrates like Pup-Peroni does.  They are cut to a good size--like a pencil's eraser-- a dog does not need to eat a whole stick for a treat-- 2 seconds of flavor is 2 seconds whether its a mini treat or a stick swallowed whole.  They do dry a little over time, but that's because they keep the preservatives to a minimum.  Leo definitely does not seem to mind the texture change, and they retain the very strong salmon smell Leo loves.<br /><br />I do, however, have one caveat for dog parents who plan to give these as training treats. For Leo, the salmon minis are what the trainers on TV call "high value" treats. It took 2 weeks for me to use them on walks at all because they made Leo too excited to walk!  When I opened our first bag, the scent hit his nostrils in the next room and he came running to me in the kitchen, as if I were cooking fish or s roast. I made the mistake of saying, "I think the mail man brought a present for Leo," and he immediately started running through his entire repertoire--small though it is. He tried to sit, lie down, sit, shake with the normal paw, shake with the other paw, lie down again, sit again--you get the picture.  I actually had to spend 2 weeks training him how to calm down enough to receive this treat! I still cannot let him use his teeth to take the treat because he is too excited and will inadvertently nip my fingers or the skin of my palm--I trained him to take it with his tongue.  He thinks the peanut butter are wonderful, but he does not become apoplectic for them.  I use the peanut butter for walking treats--he loves them enough to walk properly, even when it's raining.  I save the salmon for dessert and to motivate him to stay calm in difficult situations, like bath day.

I also love that they are 2 calories each, another reason they are perfect for training. Just make sure you keep the bag closed, or they will dry out! The salmon flavor doesn't smell too strong or make your hands smell. My dog also loves the peanut butter flavor, which actually smell delicious! These treats are moist, which my dog seems to prefer. We haven't bought the chicken flavor yet but I'm sure they are excellent as well. I will never be without these treats!

review/text: I tried this for my dogs for the first time a few months back. They are the pickest dogs about treats that i have ever seen and the only things i could get them to eat was another known brand of the chicken nuggets. I decided to try these and they we're smaller then i expected but i gave them a try anyways and i could not believe it. They all ate it right up and now after 2 more orders of them they are still begging for them every night. If i don't give them one or forget to they all sit and stare at me or bark untill i do. I do use them as treats rather then for training. I hope they never quit selling this product and the shipping was really fast not to mention the good price and the large bag size. Thanks for everything. I will keep buying this for as long as i can.

review/summary: My cockapoo puppy loves these!
review/text: My pup, Miltie, is 7.5 months old and so far he's not tired of the Zuke's treats at all, and he's had them since the first month I brought him home. He sometimes eats too fast, but I've had no problem with him throwing up. Other treats have given him "poopy" messes, but he doesn't have that with Zuke's, which are worth the money.  He's had PB & Chicken mini treats, Filet Mignon chews...he adores them all, and the 16-oz. bag of mini treats can last him a long time. The trainer is his puppy kindergarten class recommended these, and I'm glad she did.<br />I'd like to get the "Dental Fresh Breath" treats, but Amazon.com doesn't ship them and the shipping is almost as much as the product...that's not cool.

review/text: I had some trouble finding kibble sized dog treats, I had been breaking up smaller ones. I needed a smaller size to work with my dog's food puzzle since he won't use it if it only has plain kibble in it. These are great! About the size of a pencil eraser or a green pea. My bag says that each treat is 3 calories, not 2 as it says in the description, just an FYI. The salmon ones stink pretty bad, but dogs love stinky treats. They are kinda moist and squashy so I wouldn't put them in my pocket. They also turn the feces black. Kinda gross. But poodle really likes these so I bought him 2 bags. For the price and usefulness, they can't be beat!

review/summary: Excellent Dog Treat
review/text: Right now, "Mini Naturals" are the only treat that I give to my dog.  I prefer them for several reasons:<br /><br />1) Ingredients:  When you buy any food or treat for your dog, it is always important to look at the ingredients and the first ingredient especially.  The first ingredient in the chicken flavored mini naturals is chicken.  In a lot of other treats it is something less nutritious like sugar or corn meal.<br /><br />2) Calories: I have a dog that gains weight easily.  Each mini natural has only 3 calories.  Many other treats have 15.  My dog has lost a little weight since I switched from the other treats I was using to mini naturals.  Although the treats are small in size, they are large and tasty enough to get my dog to do what I want him to do (most of the time).<br /><br />3) Flavor: My dog seems to like the chicken flavor the most.  He will eat the others but definitely seems to notice the difference and have a preference for chicken.  They all look the same to us but maybe not to our dogs.<br /><br />4) Buying on Amazon: I have been buying mine at a health pet food store.  But I was pleased to notice that it is actually a better deal to buy them on Amazon.  I will be doing this in the future.

We usually get the salmon because the smell is irresistible to our dog. When I have them around, a whiff and a look from me and our dog is sitting & staying for a treat. We also stuff a kong with it sometimes. We have 2 more bags around just so that we don't run out. We tried the peanut butter, it was great too but we keep coming back to salmon.

You can't go wrong with these. I'm ordering more just in case they stop making them!

review/summary: Great price for a good solid training size treat for allergic dogs
review/text: There are other treats that my dogs would do anything for...  but I'm too busy to make them boiled chicken bits all the time. And I can't feed them bits of last nights steak since my poor minature pinscher is allergic to everthing.<br /><br />But with Zukes... he avoids wheat, corn, beef, milk, oats, all other sneaky grains/fillers/etc and he only gets the good stuff that he deserves and that his poor skin/coat can handle!<br /><br />And don't get me wrong... they will do plenty to get these little bites of good stuff, which is great because when I do have fresh meat for them to eat they tend to get too excited trying to get at it to hold a sit for long enough to deserve a treat!

review/summary: good treats but dog did not like them much
review/text: My dog liked the smell of these at first and got really excited, but she got bored after just a couple of these treats. I had to use them as filler treats during training to get rid of them. I will not buy these again, since she doesn't like them, but the treats themselves are good, healthy and low-calorie.

review/summary: Dog doesn't like them
review/text: My maltipoo is pretty picky with food and treats and she absolutely hates these treats. I've tried offering them to her and she won't eat it. I tried putting them in her food and she'll just pick around it. I've only tried peanut butter and salmon. I bought all three flavors. I plan on trying the chicken one soon to see if she likes that one, but I don't think it'll win her over

review/summary: GREAT TREATS!!
review/text: I purchased Zuke's mini naturals in the Chicken flavor based on all the amazing reviews I had read on Amzon.com. Not only I was so pleased with thisproduct, so was my lil 4 months old lab pup! My husband and I used these mini treats for training and rewarding. The product was a great value as well. Just because each individual treat was so tiny and there were so many of them in one bag...it would've lasted a lot longer...if my mischeivious pupppy didn't get into the bag when my husband and I were gone...Yes, he loved these treats SO much, maybe too much that he ATE the ENTIRE BAG!!!! I was really concerned at first when we found out he had eaten almost a full bag (I bought the 1 lb bag about 2 weeks ago, so it wasn't completed full but there were still A TON of left in the bag). But, I was a little bit relieved knowing at least this product was made out of all natural and high quality ingredients. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 start was although the treats were made out of all natural and high quality ingredients, the smell was AWEFUL! My husband wouldn't even reach into the bag to get the treats...and after I gave these treats to my puppy, I had to wash my hands to get the smell off. That was my only complain about this product, otherwise, AWESOME product! I didn't plan on purchasing another 1 pound bag that soon but since my pup ate em all, I'll have to buy it AGAIN!

review/text: These little treats are excellent for training.  We have a small 7lb Shorkie (Shih Tzu/Yorkie mix) and he loves these things.  I have been able to teach him tricks and have him obey commands by using these treats.  They are one of the better treats out there for dogs as they do not contain corn.  The treats are very easy to break in half also for smaller servings.  They have other flavors as well, Salmon & Peanut butter but our dog seems to love the chicken ones.  We also put these in a food cube and make our dog work for them as well.  I definitely would recommend these.

I can't believe when I found the 1 lb. bag for $9 on Amazon and I ordered it as my Shih Tzu loves these salmon treats.  We used them to train her.  It uses all natural ingredients which is very important to us.  However, it can be kind of smelly since it is made of fish(salmon).

They have a very strong odor, when makes them impossible for my dog to resist and an excellent reward for obedience training.  I highly recommend these treats.  **You should note that these treats will dry out quickly if you carry them in your pocket or leave them lying out.  They need to be keep in a container or baggie when you carry them so they will stay moist.

review/summary: Don't hold Dog's attention, Gas
review/text: I bought the chicken flavored treats for my dog. She'd eat them if I handed them to her, but they definitely weren't good enough for her to come running to me on a recall. That makes them kind of useless as training treats, which they're perfectly sized for.<br /><br />She also got serious gas from these treats.. which suggests they're probably lower quality food. Maybe your dog will like them, but if he/she's picky, don't bother.<br /><br />I just buy franks at the store and cut them up small. It's cheaper by far, and I can eat them as well. I usually microwave them long enough on high so they dry up, then they make perfect treats that don't make your hands sticky, but my dog likes them fresh a little better. Just a heads up.

review/summary: not for spoiled/finicky dogs who prefer stella and chewys
review/text: as a new dog owner, i made the mistake of feeding my dog super-premium, filler-free raw food and treats from stella and chewys since she was a pup. But because of the high price of Stella and Chewys, i switched to the Zukes mini chicken treats. My mini dachshund turned her nose up at the treats, over and over.  Even with nothing else to eat in the home, she actually preferred gnawing on her deer antler over the Zuke's.<br /><br />i'm not saying that these treats are bad at all---but it may be a waste of money for overindulged dogs with "caviar tastes" that have been spoiled by their owners (especially small companion dogs).

He absolutely loves them and they are the perfect size for training. And since they are only 2 calories each, I don't feel too bad about giving him a handful. My only complaints are that they are kind of stinky (probably because of the fish oil) but it's nothing unbearable, and that because they are moist treats, they can dry out easily if you forget to seal the bag completely. Other than that, we both love these treats and I would recommend them to anyone.

That being said, my boys will not hesitate to eat them if they do get dried out from leaving them in the bait bag.  At the 4-for-3 promotion price, you can't go wrong!

review/summary: My sheltie love these treats (and so does my sister's cat)
review/text: My 30 lb shetland sheepdog is picky.  She's fed a high-quality food, and she only gets the best treats.  No "doggie junk food" to be had in our household, no corn, no by-products, no treats pressed and colored to look like mini T-bone steaks (unfortunately, I don't eat as well as she does.... Doritos can pass as a meal for me).  She's been known to spit out treats that didn't meet her standards.<br /><br />Not so with these Zuke's Mini Naturals.  These really get her attention, and they were vital in training her to go potty as soon as I let her out into the backyard, to let me brush her teeth, and to walk nicely on a leash (nothing on our walks is more interesting than Mama or Daddy in possession of Zuke's Minis).  My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag.<br /><br />She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken.  It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, salmon, comes from salmon being the first ingredient on the ingredient list.  The texture is soft, not crunchy, and they don't fall apart in your pocket, nor are they greasy or stinky.<br /><br />Also, we've found that my sister's cat goes nuts for these Zuke's in the salmon flavor.  They're not intended for cats, but my sister's cat apparently didn't read the package when she found and inhaled these.<br /><br />These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again.

review/text: My pomeranian is 11 and will eat any treats. Heck, she eats more produce than most people do. So we bought the duck jerky and peanut butter bits. She won't touch either one. Now, she has never been given duck food so I'm not shocked that she wouldn't put it in her mouth, but she eats peanut butter like crazy. So, I looked at the ingredients and both packages contain tumeric, rosemary, and sage. I think that the seasoning may be what turn many dogs off. My dog won't eat seasoned meat. I'm not positive that this is the problem, or everyone's problem, but I don't see any other ingredients that would turn off dogs. Our pet supply store gave us a full refund and we chose another treat that she goes crazy over.

review/summary: Salmon and Peanut Butter
review/text: My dog LOVES these, especially the peanut butter ones.  He goes insane when i open the bag, and they are perfect for training. Id recommend cutting them in half for puppies, smaller dogs. they are already small, but it makes them easier to swallow and continue with rapid training. Dont listen to people about how bad they smell, sure they don;t smell like roses, but the smell is more than tolerable. The people say it is unbearable must have the most sensitive olfactory in the world. Just rinse your hands with water after, and the smell is gone. I prefer the smell of the peanut butter ones, and my dog loves them. gets reaaly excited, which is what i need when training him

review/summary: My dog loves these Zukes!
review/text: I got these treats because we needed chewy treats that our soft-coated wheaten terrier puppy could eat quickly during training. We had a lot of the cookie type treats earlier but it took too long for him to break apart the dry treats and lick up the crumbs. He'd also run around having only half-swallowed the treat and I worried about him choking. These treats were recommended to me by a friend and they have solved these problems.<br /><br />PROS<br />-- Our dog loves these treats. LOVES them. Mostly because they are so moist and chewy.<br />-- Even though they are chewy, the treats don't leave any residue on your hands or anything-- they are very clean.<br />-- quick and easy to chew. Seems to be a lot less unhealthy than many other treats out there.<br />-- definitely gets him to pay attention!<br /><br />CONS<br />-- you have to be careful of leaving the bag open as the treats can dry out, although I think you can put a damp napkin in and re-hydrate the treats.<br />-- These are a little too expensive for regular use, especially if you have a bigger dog.<br /><br />Our dog is medium sized and it is easy to go through these treats pretty quickly. Then again, you really need treats that a dog will go wild for, and these do the trick. Overall, these are great treats that we'd recommend to anyone that is looking for high quality dog treats. When he finishes his training for the day we toss a small handful of these around he floor and let him hunt them all down (he is a terrier so he loves it!).

review/summary: Love the idea, can't stand the smell!
review/text: My dog and I both love Zuke's.  The mini naturals are great for training because they are small but super flavorful.  This means that you don't have to cut them up or break them into little pieces (I'm looking at you, Buddy Biscuits), but your dog will still go the distance to earn them.  The small size makes them super convenient.  I have used the peanut butter, chicken, and salmon flavors.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the salmon flavor has an awful stench.  I am used to reeking like dog treats, but the salmon odor is too much.  Upon opening the bag for the first time, I gagged.  Even now, several months after purchasing the 1lb bag, I am still trying to get rid of these treats.  I tried passing them off on my mother, but she wouldn't take them because of the smell.  Yesterday I decided I would just bite the bullet and use them for training for a few days, but after just a couple minutes in the bag I use for treats, I gave up.  I just couldn't take it.  I stuck them back in the bag they came in.  I think I will mix the remaining treats with a giant glob of peanut butter to try to get rid of them in one stinky fell swoop.<br /><br />So Zuke's: we love you.  You have a great mission that both my dog and I both appreciate in our own ways.  The salmon mini naturals, however, definitely miss the mark.  We'll stick to the chicken and peanut butter flavors.

review/text: This is a great treat to put inside the Premier Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug Treat Dispensing Dog Toy.  My 60 pound 6 year old "puppy" goes nuts whenever she gets this treat/toy combo.  It is one of her favorite treats, it has a (moist treat) smell to it (which I think is tolerable and is what makes the dogs smell it from a mile away).  This bag barley lasts a month and I don't even give it to her every day.  One you open the seal, your dog will keep asking for more. Bag is resealable to help treats fresh.  Great for training too!

review/summary: Wonderful Treats for training
review/text: Just have to say that the treats are great for training. They are small enough that they don't fill up your small - medium sized dog and allow for enough time to work on a couple of tricks or actions each day. I choose peanut butter just because I know my dog loves it and we don't have to get really messy with something like a kong or anything. The overall training has been going really well with these as I can take a handful and have more than enough left for each training session. I will say that the one thing is that they are small enough that you sometimes worry that the dog is going to bite your hand and not the treat so make sure to palm feed your dog and not try to pinch the food between two fingers.

review/summary: Dog Loves Treats but Bad for His Teeth
review/text: My dog loves this treat and it's great for training and teaching tricks.  I would not recommend them if you have a small dog prone to dental decay.  After going through many bags of these treats I learned that small dogs prone to dental problems should not have soft or sticky treats because they may promote dental problems. I did not know this and he recently had to have 7 teeth pulled.  I don't think it was entirely the fault of this particular treat but a combination of problems, but I think it could have been a factor. Overall, these are great for training.

review/text: These treats are wonderful. They are healthy and you can tell they are full of EFA's. They do smell to high heaven of fish, so if you can't stand that smell, you won't like these. My dog won't eat fish, but she LOVES these. My dog does not drool, except when you open these up! These are her favorite treats, and she is a 45lb medium mutt. They are perfect for training rewards. She hates having her nails clipped, so when we clip her nails, I have my fiance pinch one of these in his fingers and she tries to get it from him and she's totally distracted from me clipping her nails. The price is right especially if you have prime!

review/text: I tried Zukes Minis after they were suggested by a vet tech as a great treat for training my new puppy.  They are soft and easy to cut into even smaller pieces so you can use a lot of them during training sessions.  The price through Amazon beats the pet and feed store prices by a long way, so I bought 3 large bags of different flavors.  The bags zip shut, so the treats stay fresh.  I just take out a handful and cut them in quarters, and keep them in another ZipLoc bag, enough for a few training sessions.  I cut them using both a pill cutter and a knife; I think using a knife is easier.  In their whole uncut size, they are only 4 calories each, so they are not a fattening treat either.  A great product I feel good about using.

review/text: I bought these treats for the size. We go through a lot of treats on walks with our dog, who has some leash issues. I get frustrated with crumbs in my pockets and breaking up treats during walks. He is a picky fellow when it comes to treats. These are, in fact, a great size, but they dry out quickly as others have commented. I can live with that, but I think they may also lose flavor. My dog has become less and less interested in them, and it's to the point now where he seems to eat them as a favor to me. For the price, I can find more appealing treats elsewhere and live with permanent crumbs in my pocket.

And for those of you label-readers, these things are made with all-natural ingredients that are great for your dog.

review/summary: Nice Little Treat, but...
review/text: The Zuke's Mini Naturals is great for training and while on walks, however, this treat will dry out fast and become very hard. My mini schnauzer will refuse the treat when it is no longer moist. The treat is ok as long as the bag is kept sealed tightly. Zuke's Mini Naturals is healthy and made in USA.

review/summary: Excellent training treat
review/text: I was always breaking treats up to give to my dog during training. I usually don't give too many treats outside of that, but these are sized perfectly for training and I don't have crumbs everywhere. My shiba goes crazy for them despite their miniature size.

review/summary: Zukes Mini Naturals
review/text: During training of Kaylee, our 75 lb. German Shepherd, we found that she does not like anything (treats or food) in large chunks. She is just a "dainty" eater and even the smallest Milk Bones dog biscuits were too big for her liking. When my neice gave her a bag of Zukes Mini Naturals for her 1st birthday she went crazy for them! They are PERFECT for training and she responds wonderfully. I highly recommend these if your dog is a "dainty" eater (I've never had one before) and even if they will swallow a hot dog whole (like my last dog, a Lab) these Mini naturals will be loved.<br />Bob

Also great for training, as you can really dish out a lot of them. Unlike some other reviewers, I find the smoky smell apealing for myself as well (I use the chicken flavor)

review/summary: Perfect training treat!!
review/text: This treat amazing for training!<br /><br />I'm writing this in regards to my 5 month old puppy, somewhat food motivated, and my 12 year old lab mix, extremely food motivated.  I can't say how the treats would do for a very fussy dog.<br /><br />It never crumbles in your pocket but splits easily for giving small training rewards.  It's tiny enough to use a bunch without filling up your dog.  It has good ingredients.  It doesn't mess with the puppy's digestion.<br /><br />The only possible drawback is that it's smelly.  Not gross, just smells like fish.  They love the treats and I'm sure the odor has something to do with it, but they also can smell it on you, so you can't surprise them with a treat.<br /><br />Overall, the go-to treat for training, rewarding, and stuffing in toys to prevent separation anxiety.

review/summary: Perfect size but smells less than perfect
review/text: My 5 month old Lab mix enjoys these treats (but he seems to enjoy any food) and I love the small size since we're still training him.  The smell isn't so great so you can't just stash a handful in your pocket unless you want your pocket to smell like them.  I knocked off 1 star in my rating just because of the smell, but if you keep the bag sealed at all times, you won't smell anything and it will keep the treats fresh.  I found the same item at my local pet store in NYC (Tribeca area) for $1 less than Amazon so I was a bit shocked that it's cheaper there than Amazon.

review/summary: Excellent Training Tidbits
review/text: I purchased these based on other great reviews, and I'm glad I did! Our newly adopted 40 lb, 9 month old Amstaff/Lab mix is very food motivated and I feel great using these for training without worrying about their health factor. Plus they are absolutely tiny (pencil eraser size). I am surprised other people cut them up, when they are so small already! I also prep and freeze a Kong for her overnight to have while we're at work, and these are the perfect size to plug up the smaller hole in a Large sized kong!<br />We have only tried the chicken flavor so far, and she loves them! They do dry out if left out, but that doesn't seem to decrease their delicious-ness factor with her. Finally, Amazon does have the best price around on them, so if you're looking for healthy, dog approved treats, go for Zuke's minis!

review/text: I have a 7 week old APBT/Golden Retriever mix who is very tiny and not so good with crunchy treats. Even small crunchies are too big and I have to break them in half an it gets pretty messy! They're also a bit too hard for her baby teeth.<br />Zuke's mini naturals are awesome because they are so small, and they are soft enough without being mushy or greasy. The ingredients are great and my puppy (and other dogs I've given them to) loves them! I bought the salmon and peanut butter ones, so far we've only tried salmon, but she goes crazy for them! Highly recommended!

review/text: We picked up a 6oz bag at petco at first (for like $7), but since our puppy loved them we committed to a bigger bag, and this was the best price around (amazon prime wins every time).<br /><br />Highly recommended for training, but remember that hotdogs are better than pretty much anything (though gross...).  These treats will dry out if left unsealed for a pretty long period of time (many days, a week?), so don't take out too many at once, but even dried she still loves them.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, definitely get them :)

review/text: My dog has agility training two days a week, so we are always trying new treats for her to assit in motivating.  We use the Zukes on a semi regular basis.  I like it because it is easy to tear the treats down to smaller sizes to make the product last.  The treat is semi smelly which is good because it helps focus are dog.<br /><br />The reason for the 4 stars is that my dog is very picky and she will defintilty try harder for certain treats.  She does like the Zukes but  she does respond better to more raw types of meat treats that we get at a specialty dog store.

So far we've only tried the chicken flavor.<br /><br />I like them for training because they are small and soft and have only a few calories so you don't have to worry about giving lots of them while teaching your dog to behave.  (I'm a puppy spoiler, so I could easily end up with a plump pup, if I'm not careful).  I couldn't find any other treats that even had the calories listed.<br /><br />The only downside to these treats is that they smell really bad. (to me, that is.)

review/text: My dog does agility so we give her Zuke's when we train. The treat is pretty smelly which is why we use them (a smelly treat will keep her attention).  She will pefrorm for Zuke's they dont seem to be her favorite treat (she performs best for bellyrybs a freezed dried liver which is too big to give as a regular treat)however in training she may eat 10 -15 treats so perhaps she gets tired of them.  The reason for the 4 stars is the treat is semi moist they do tend to dry out if left exposed for too long or if you improperly seal the bag.  Also my rating is based on my dogs preference for several other types of treats (on treats she will love she will knock our other dog down to get the treat).

My dog loves it, and I give it to her as a reward for staying while being groomed, or pooping and peeing outside. She always wants more. Of course I only give her 2 at a time. These would last forever since there are so many in a bag. Amazon has these for like $3 something, great for getting up to $25 free shipping thresh hold too. My dog loves these and they do not irratate her stomach in any way as the ingredients are natural, meaty, no filler and healthy for her. The treats themselvesa re moist and smells like meat. Dogs do love moist treats more than dry treats, so the yare great for training. Highly recommend it.

review/text: I received these as a gift from a friend, and I was a little wary because our dog is very picky when it comes to treats.  He usually turns his nose up at most things.  Although it took a few sniffs to get him to try them, he now loves these.  We just used them to teach him to shake hands, and it took less than a day for him to learn his new trick with the Zuke's.  I would definitely recommend these.  (BTW, we also tried the beef Z filets, which he also loves).

review/summary: Zuke's Mini Naturals
review/text: These are excellent treats for training. They are the perfect size and you can put them in your pocket without worrying about your pocket smelling like dog treats or leaving crumbs behind. My dog likes all three flavors. The treats do become harder inside the bag after a month or two, so I would only open one bag at a time.  The price on Amazon is considerable less than at a pet store.

If you are having trouble with your dog heeling or following you around the house, just keep a few of these in your pocket and she'll follow you everywhere! My dog absolutely can't wait for 'training sessions' with these treats and because they are so small she can be rewarded often for following commands. I highly recommend them.

review/summary: My sheltie love these treats
review/text: My 30 lb shetland sheepdog is picky.  She's fed a high-quality food, and she only gets the best treats.  No "doggie junk food" to be had in our household, no corn, no by-products, no treats pressed and colored to look like mini T-bone steaks (unfortunately, I don't eat as well as she does.... Doritos can pass as a meal for me).  She's been known to spit out treats that didn't meet her standards.<br /><br />Not so with these Zuke's Mini Naturals.  These really get her attention, and they were vital in training her to go potty as soon as I let her out into the backyard, to let me brush her teeth, and to walk nicely on a leash (nothing on our walks is more interesting than Mama or Daddy in possession of Zuke's Minis).  My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag.<br /><br />She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken.  It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, chicken, comes from chicken being the first ingredient on the ingredient list.  The texture is soft, not crunchy, and they don't fall apart in your pocket, nor are they greasy or stinky.<br /><br />These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again.

Dried beef lung stinks up the entire room until she consumes it all).<br /><br />These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again.<br /><br />UPDATE: Apparently the ingredients have changed for the PB flavor... the 1st two ingredients are now ground barley and rice, with actual PB coming in as the 3rd ingredient.  My sheltie still loves 'em though!

review/summary: Best dog treat - great for training
review/text: We have a 10-month-old boxer and found a trainer to work with us.  The trainer recommended these treats for training because they're small and the dog doesn't have to stop and chew and chew between activities.  Also, these chicken and salmon treats seem to have healthier ingredients than most other dog treats.  Truthfully, I am not an expert on what's good or bad for dogs nutritionally, but I'm sitting here looking at two dog treat bags.  One has dried whey, palm kernel oil, sugar, dicalcium phosphate, maltodextrin, defatted peanut flour, salt, soy lecithin and caramel.  Basically sounds like candy.  Mini naturals have chicken, ground barley, ground rice, lots of vitamins...no detectable sugars.  Maybe dogs don't need the grains, but the protein-based, no-sugar recipe seems like a better choice.  Try a bag and if you don't like them, you can return the unused portion to the company for a full refund.

review/text: This is one of the few brands that have treats appropriately small enough for my Chiuaua-mix. But, having been the owner of a large dog, these would also be great for training large dogs.  Dogs don't really have a sense of size- they're as happy with a small bite as a much larger treat! And you don't want you're dog to be too busy chewing when you want to keep his/her attention and repeat a behavior.  These treats are just the right size!

review/text: Finding these treats was a complete fluke. When on vacation in Hollywood, FL we stopped in a gourmet pet store. There was a cute yorkie that we were petting and we told the owner we had Chihuahuas. He was buying Zukes and absolutely raved about the treats. He recommended the chicken but we purchased the peanut butter treat. We keep the treats in the fridge. My dogs LOVE these treats. If we open the fridge they are right there. The size is perfect for training. I can't say enough great things about the product, healthy and it makes my dogs happy.

review/summary: Great size for training but absolutely unbearable smell
review/text: I thought these looked perfect for training so I gave them a try.  The problem is that even in a sealed bag inside a separate sealed ziplock, the smell of these treats is unbearable.  We tried keeping them in the car, but the car would retain the horrible smell for days.  We eventually ending up keeping them in a sealed container in the back yard until the bag was gone.  If you touch them with your fingers, your hand will smell of them until you can wash your hands.  Disappointing as they are a perfect size for training, but I will not buy them again.  I wish they would make a similar treat without the odor.

review/summary: Great for training and dogs who just love getting treats!
review/text: I originally bought a 6 ounce bag of these treats at my local pet store for 4$ a bag.  The owner recommended them because they are made from healthy items, and they are only 3 calories a treat.  The low calorie and healthy ingredients are a big plus when you are feeding them to your dog as a reward for training.<br /><br />The treats are moist, but do not leave a greasy residue on your hands if you are holding a bunch as rewards. The treats have a slight smell, but not anywhere near as much as some of the other moist treats on the market.  They are small in size, but provide quick satisfaction to my 50 pound dog and have really helped her learning process.<br /><br />As an amusing anecdote, my 6 pound Siamese/tiger mix loves the treats as well! Whenever she hears the bag, she comes running and will sit and "assist" me in training the dog, as long as she gets her fair share as well!

review/text: They smell HORRIBLE!  I bought a bag of these, expecting them to smell like chicken but instead I got a huge whiff of some gross chemical smell.  I didn't even give them to my dogs because I felt like the smell was just too wrong.  Call me crazy but "natural" dog treats shouldn't smell like chemicals at all.  Plus, what the heck are all of the chemical names at the end of the ingredients list?  Doesn't sound very natural to me.<br /><br />I think I'll be sticking with Natural Pups since their treats actually smell like the flavors they're supposed to be and they're way healthier.

review/summary: Salmon Treats have strong smell
review/text: Sadly my dog is NOT fond of these even though she does like salmon and anything smelly! She will eat them (the first treat she rolled on as she'll do if I give her lox) but she won't do tricks for them and acts as if they were a run of the mill dog food instead of a treat. Both my mate and I found the smell rather unpleasant similar to old B vitamins or really old liver treats, not like salmon..<br />(FYI My is dog is medium sized black mutt.)<br />UPDATE:My dog seems to be getting used to these to some degree she will now do some tricks perhaps she prefers them a little dried out (they are still soft)or even maybe she was addicted to other treats though I usually only give her wheat and gluten free treats like freeze dried liver and dogswell treats..Perhaps she's stil not crazy about them because these treats do have natural gluten in the form of malted barley and ground barley (Not that good for me in terms of cross contamination as I am gluten sensitive and perhaps she is too?) Left a message for Zukes' but never heard back from them.. They are convenient in that they are small

review/summary: Perfect treat for training and other things
review/text: I've bought Zukes Mini Treats, chicken for such a long time.  I heard about it on TV series.  So when I checked at a store, they, to me, were expensive, some sites are better.<br /><br />BUT Amazon, so far, beats all prices.  I never thought that these treats would work so fast, it's amazing. Yes I saw it on TV, since I'm not sure one is allowed to say which series it is, I won't say what it is.<br /><br />First time I bought Zukes, 1 pound, (got two dogs), I bought it long ago, with other products, and like I wrote, both dogs learned fast, everytime I train, or make sure they always are good, mainly outside, they actually know I have those mini Chicken treats...probably the smell, and we have 2 Labs, so I guess it's the smell.<br /><br />First time I used them, it was only when they gave positive reaction.  I was quit surprised it didn't take long as dogs do remember, so when I give command, and they listen, I praise them, give them each the treat.<br /><br />I also got one of those treat packages, comes in handy outside.<br /><br />I have to say they remember better than I do, meaning when I say something new, a new learning thing, it seemed, at at least to me, that they knew if they did it, they'd get a treat.<br /><br />I want to make clear that although on occassion on some dogs, it takes longer to learn, but they do.  But also, there WILL come a time that they just do what they're told, like "not try to dig under fence, or try to go after Cats", that they actually do listen, but when they come inside doggie door when I call them, they sit and wait before going in the house.  So, yes, I give each of them one mini chicken treat.<br />Then they go in the house, and they both play.<br /><br />But in the house, if or when things get out hand, like door bell ringing, the best word for me that I taught was a stern "NO!" that takes their attention off the door.<br /><br />Here's a tip, another thing I used a long time ago...because dogs do what dogs do, meaning we have so many cats in the neighborhood, not easy to get them in the house.<br /><br />I started with a clicker, inside house, they know that clicking sound they get the mini chicken treat.  That, at last for us, WORKS ALL THE TIME.<br /><br />I really don't know what else to say, other than if anyone is going to try the treats, make sure you try the chicken first, they seem, at least our dogs, love that chicken.  One pound of those treats are far better price than 8oz.<br /><br />Just make sure it comes from Amazon, anything over $25.00 you don't pay postage. (unless you don't care about postage, or you're rich..lol )<br /><br />The 3rd parties also, I found, but ONLY SOMETIMES, they also don't charge postage.  What I'm trying to say is if economy is hurting you, then just take the time, as I do, and just check out the prices.<br /><br />If anyone has any questions, or even suggestions as I always like suggestions, please feel free to contact me.<br /><br />Now I feel better doing the review. I should have done more reviews, I plead guilty to that.  In a way, this was fun to do.  Thank you for reading my review, and hope, especially if you have hard time training, hope you try these treats.<br /><br />Just remember THIS, never YELL, or NEVER EVER hit your dog, that is so wrong, especially if it's trained, and somebody wants to pet him/her, the dog will DEFINATELY think he or she might be hit.  Dogs are, indeed, smarter than people realize, and from 1967 til present, I always find out new things about our dogs, as we adopt them, they are wonderful animals to have, they WILL protect you, LOVE you, and do anything for you.<br /><br />I know this to be true..., so believe me when I say Dogs are great, my view is GREAT for us Senior Citizens, they do protect us, and in my case one literally saved my life in July, 2008.<br /><br />So reminding you if anyone has any questions, please ask, or recommendations, that's cool too, always listen to recommendations. :-)

review/summary: Chicken treats are STINKY!
review/text: My dog loved these treats but be aware that the Chicken treats reek!  You must make sure the bag stays closed and always wash your hands right after touching them. You certainly don't want to walk around with these in your pocket.  We didn't purchase these from Amazon but price is about what we paid.

review/text: These treats may be great for some dogs, but my golden did not like the taste.  I had hoped to use them as small training treats (such as the BilJac liver treats), but she would have nothing to do with either the peanut butter or the salmon flavor. The salmon variety has a very strong "fishy" smell, too.

review/summary: Sour Smell emailed company
review/text: I received the Zukes Chicken Mini's a couple of days ago. I opened the bag and the smell that came out of it was a sour almost vinegar smell, much like pickles in away. I fed the dogs one each then thought I better not give them anymore. I emailed the company and asked if that was normal. Matt the contact sent this message:<br /><br />Hi Kerrie-<br /><br />They are definitely strong in smell. If you have not smelled them before<br />they may seem a little odd smelling. The dogs think they are candy! They<br />should be perfectly fine. One thing to check is the bottom/underside of<br />the bag and make sure the "best by" date is still good. If that is in<br />range I would say everything is good to feed to your dog. Thank You for<br />your inquiry and for supporting Zuke's!<br /><br />Matt Porray<br />"Bone Counselor"<br />Customer Service<br />Zuke's<br /><br />They date on the bag is for November 2013 so they are well within the expiration date.<br />But I emailed a friend (who in the past has donated many bags of Zukes treats to the dog club I used to belong for training classes) and I asked her the same question she felt they were not safe to feed with them smelling sour (vinegar like). I had never fed the chicken flavor before.<br />I think Iwill be sending these back. I am very disappointed, I don't mind treats that stink I feed a freeze dried green trip treat those really smell. The Zukes didn't smell like something even dogs would eat.

review/summary: Who Says Dog Treats Are Just For Dogs?
review/text: Once again, Zuke's has made a snack that'll give you an attack. I have always been a fan of dog food for as long as I can remember. It is cheap, delicious, and for the most part very easy on the bowels. Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals remind us all that dog treats are yummy for people, too.<br /><br />Zukes is taking us back. Back to the basics. 16 ounces of pure chicken delight, crisp and crunchy. And if you happen to have a dog, this is a treat you can share with your pet. It does not actually taste like chicken, more of a seitan meatloaf, but it tastes better than most chickens I have eaten. (I grew up on a farm in Virginia, so that's a big deal!)<br /><br />Treat yourself to Zuke's chicken-flavored treats. And maybe you can give one to your dog, too!

review/summary: Zero stars if I could
review/text: Less than 24 hours after my four year old dog ate a Zuke's "all-natural" bone, she developed pancreatitis!!! There was no other change in her diet, environment or anything but that Zuke's bone. When I took her to the vet, she was dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea... and she had to stay at the vet for three days. Over $1,000 in vet bills later, I gave Zuke's hq a call to let them know. While symphathetic, basically Zuke's gave me a $15 check to cover the cost of the bone, but failed to take responsibility for the incident, even though the vet wrote a note saying the bone was the most likely cause. Stay away from this and all Zuke's "all-natural" products!

review/summary: First Ingredient: Peanut Butter.... My Dog Loves Them
review/text: WOW.  NOTE:  No Wheat, Corn, Soy, Artificial Colors, Flavors and no Added Fat or By-Products.  On the Label, the first ingredient is Peanut Butter.  Made in USA.<br /><br />My chihuahua loves these things.  Although they are small, they are not as tiny as the berrybuddies we tried first (I don't even know what to do with those, they fall out at alarming rates from the buddy-toys hole).<br /><br />These - - he can chew, it's like he's eating peanut butter for a moment.  He doesn't just woof them down - he actually eats them.  I give him one at a time, and he sits and chews it for 10-20 seconds - much like peanut butter I would imagine.  They fit perfectly in the KONG toys (but not the busybuddy ones, they are smaller holes).<br /><br />The chicken ones were a bit too flavored for him - so I pinch them in half and add a few to his food - then he loves it - mixed with his food & warm water.  I want to try all the flavors!<br /><br />I also like that the company supports a cause with each bag purchased.  Very natural, very chewy little things, and my dog LOVES them.  Very good value.  Will be keeping these around for sure.

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: The Zuke's Chicken Flavored Treats are just what I was hoping they would be! I got the chicken flavor (despite other claims of serious odor) because it was the cheapest flavor. My dog LOVES them. Her affinity for them, coupled with their size makes them perfect for training.  They are small little cylinders which are about 1/4" thick and less than 1/2" wide. They are enough to keep her interest, but not too substantial that they distract from training as she's chewing, as usually happens with a biscuit-type treat. They are also great for use inside the Kong Genius Leo (I have a size Large). They are thinner than a similar treat by a different brand which I found at my local Petco. I like that they're smaller because the other ones would get stuck in the tube of the Leo. These slide in and out without much friction at all. I don't find the odor to be as offensive as others have described. The odor is about average for moist treats, in my opinion. In fact, they smell very similar to my cat's treats.  So much so that my cat tries to steal them when I lay them on the floor while the dog is practicing "stay."  Also, you really can't beat the value! Treats can go so quickly when used during training and it's nice to find a quality treat that doesn't break the bank! I will definitely be buying these again!

review/text: These treats are relatively healthy when compared to the competition. They could be better by excluding grains and salt but they are treats after all. These are made in the USA which is a big bonus and they do not contain ethoxyquin which is a harmful preservative found in many dog foods and treats. I usually split these treats into 2 pieces, which is easily done just by squishing the 2 ends together. This makes my puppy feel like he's getting more treats.

review/text: Zuke's Chicken Flavored Mini treats are perfect for training dogs, especially a puppy in my case.  I picked these treats for my new 8 week old goldendoodle puppy.  She immediately loved them.  Since puppies have such short attention spans and require so much training, I need to use them frequently!  They are very reasonably priced compared to most products found in pet stores and have all natural healthy ingredients.  The small size of these treats allows you to get great use out of them, while giving them to your dog frequently for good behavior.  You won't need to constantly replenish your supply either.

They are NOT too tiny for my Great Dane and I can use a lot of them without filling him up and expanding his waist.  He loves the flavor, the smell is strong enough to entice without being offensive. The peanut butter flavor has not upset his sensitive stomach. They arent messy on your hands or in your pockets. They will dry out if left outside the package for any length of time so I usually separate some into a small tupperware type container for home and into small ziploc bags for carrying to classes or on walks. I will sometimes put a handful in my pocket and these actually survive the washing machine (not sure if that is good or bad).

He has also always completely destroyed any stuffed squeaker toy he has ever touched in a matter of minutes.  Not with these babies around. One whiff and the toy is forgotten; no fighting, no biting, no stuffing to pick up.  These are magic!  I only wish I'd known about them a decade sooner. Thanks.

I use the chicken flavored ones and I am really impressed with both how much the dogs like them and how much they smell like real food.  I thought that I would make this quick video to show the treats (and my dogs) in action.

review/text: My dog loves these!  I've only tried the salmon and peanut butter, I held off on the chicken due to other reviews saying it smells bad.  I prefer the peanut butter by far, the salmon is a bit stinky.  I noticed that my hands as well as my dog smelled fishy after giving him treats and petting for a job well done.  Treat size is perfect although they do tend to dry out if you don't keep them in a well sealed container.

review/summary: Great Treats! Our lab loves them.
review/text: These are great treats. I echo what other reviewers have said that they are great for training and you can't beat the fact that they are so low in calories. We previously tried Milk Bone Dry Treats and a few semi-soft options - all bigger treats, but these tasty little treats appear to be our labs favorite.<br /><br />Will only buy Zuke's in the future!

review/summary: Smelled Awful & Dog Wouldn't Eat
review/text: I purchased the chicken flavor.  When I opened the bag, the smell was very unpleasant.<br />I offered one to my dog and he wouldn't eat it.  The entire contents went into the trash.

review/summary: My dog doesn't like them!
review/text: My yellow lab, who loves any and all food, does not like these! I get them out and she doesn't come running, so that's the perfect indication. I pull out some other snacks to lure her into her crate and she bounds in - but not with these!

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: Let me start by saying my dog weighs 24 lbs but should be 17 lbs. I make this point because she is overweight and will eat anything.I purchased these treats because they are low calorie, all natural and had great reviews. I tried for 3 days but she wouldn't eat even 1 little morsel.Obviously I was disappointed and also shocked like I stated she's 7 years old and will eat anything. Maybe the bag I received was stale but wasted my money and tossed into the garbage.

review/summary: Not up to expectations, more like gelatin than chicken
review/text: Our dogs love chicken so, after reading all of the positive reviews and noting that the first ingredient was chicken, I was really hopeful that these would be their new favorite treat. They sometimes will play with them for a minute but will not eat them and are not the least bit excited about them. They even lost interest in the sound of the treat jar that normally gets them very excited. These treats feel and look more like a wad of gelatin than chicken and have been relegated to the trash bin. They would be a little on the expensive side if they actually were mostly chicken but they are way overpriced for sort of chicken gel wads.<br /><br />While almost everything "tastes like chicken" these treats don't, as evidenced by the fact that our chicken-loving dogs do not like them one bit.

review/summary: would be okay if they didnt get hard after 5 minutes
review/text: I originally bought the Zuke's Treats for Cats on Amazon.com. It arrived in a decent amount of time (I didn't expect it to be quick since I used the free shipping). My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether.<br />Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk. So if your pet likes hard food then they might like them (and they are real ingredients,) but if your pet is like mine, they wont touch them. I now have two barely opened packages of this stuff that just sits under my cupboard.

review/summary: my dogs love the peanut butter!
review/text: First off, read the ingredients, no crazy words I can't pronounce, which means it's all natural! I got the peanut butter treats for my two children: husky/shepherd and a lab/shepherd mix, and they can't get enough of them. Plus, on Amazon, this is such a great value for 16oz. Beats petsmart for sure! I'll be looking for more Zuke's products now that I've discovered them. Thanks Zuke's!
