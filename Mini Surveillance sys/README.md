In this project, I utilized and tied together a Raspberry Pi 4, various technologies such as an API, various Python libraries, and 
some Linux / Terminal skills in order to produce a fully functioning miniature surveillance system.

The main components of this project are the PIR motion sensor, multiple buzzers, and an LED light, 
along with the Sinch API (which utilizes various phone numbers to reach out to customers in the case of a 
large business like Doordash) and a camera to construct the main features.

Upon detecting motion, the system triggers the camera to commence a ten-second recording of the event.
Simultaneously, the LED illuminates, the buzzers sound, and I promptly receive a phone call alerting me to the
situation. Subsequently, the system sends the video recording of the event to my email. I have the choice to reset
the system for another cycle or deactivate it when it activates.
