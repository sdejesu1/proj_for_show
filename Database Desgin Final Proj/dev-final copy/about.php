    <h3>About the website</h3>
    <p>     This website is a personal project, where you get to select existing content from a database of content, or submit your own content to the database, all to include the content in your own list. Your list will be your little hub where all your content is shown, including fun metrics like your rating of the content, what episode you're on of a TV show, a chapter in a book, and so on. For example, if you're planning on making a list of movies you've watched, along with the rating you gave it, you can do that with your list, alongside TV shows you've watched, books you've read, etc. If you go to the home page and see a movie you've seen, you can add it to your list, as well as what you rate it. If you want to upload a book you've read that doesn't exist on the website, you can upload it yourself, and contribute to the database, and add it to your list! Everyone's list may be different, since everyone can sign up to have their own account with a unique username, and a list that selects data from the user and the content database, and presents it in one concise list.</p>
    <p>     This idea was inspired by a Google Docs list of movies and tv shows that my friend and I created, in order to watch them all and write what volume, chapter, or episode we left on off, and we rated it. I thought to myself, this might be a cool idea to expand on, and now it is a fully functioning website.</p>
